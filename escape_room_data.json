Using the method of refraction, you will notice the liquid \ninside certain chemical flasks distorts the directions on the wall behind it as you look through them, \ncreating a different directional sequence as you would have originally seen. \nStep 2: Some of the flasks will be filled with enough liquid to distort the directions whilst others will \nnot, ensuring that the answer is not the exact opposite of the original sequence. The newly revealed \ndirection sequence made of 9 left/right directions, must now be entered into the toggle switch panel \nlocated on the lower portion of the antidote assembly unit. Doing so will unlock the compartment at its \nbase, releasing the antidote vial. \nStep 3: Take the final antidote vial and place it into the top of the antidote release podium that should be \nlocated in the first room near to the exit door. There is a rounded slot at the top of the podium to fit the \nantidote vial into.

The newly revealed \ndirection sequence is made up of 9 left/right directions. However, this must be translated into a \nsequence of up/down direction so that it can be entered into the toggle switches inside the blast box. \nThis is done using the arrow instructions that we advise to be placed on the inside of the blast box. \nReplicate the new directional sequence on the blast box toggle switches to release the final antidote vial \nfrom the side compartment built into the blast box (as normal).\nStep 3: Take the final antidote vial and place it into the top of the antidote release podium that should be \nlocated in the first room near to the exit door.

The group claims to be drawing inspiration from former most wanted hacker, \nNitro, who attempted to orchestrate a multimillion-dollar cyber heist some years ago. While we had \nthought that threat to be neutralized, these copycat criminals are threatening to launch an attack on an \nunprecedented scale, potentially plunging the nation into a severe financial crisis.\nTheir target\u2026 a digital vault safeguarding a cryptocurrency fortune valued at over one hundred billion \nUS dollars. Cipher claims to have developed an  advanced AI-based program capable of breaching the \nvaults firewall and granting them access to the massive fortune within a 60 minute window. Worse still, \nthe program has been designed to penetrate even the most robust online security systems, enabling \nCipher to access classified data on a global scale, posing an even greater threat to international security. \nAs elite members of a specialized FBI Task Force, extensively trained in cyber security and criminal \ninvestigation, you have traced a lead to a remote warehouse suspected to be the hackers\u2019 hideout. \nBut your opponents are smart and you quickly realize that you\u2019ve walked right into their trap, finding \nyourselves locked in their domain with damning evidence pointing at you and seemingly no way out. \nReacting fast, you grasp the advantage of your remote location, affording you valuable time to devise a \nplan and find an escape route. \nCopycat criminals often emulate the tactics of their role models, granting a high likelihood that a kill code \nexists, something Nitro once adopted, capable of shutting down the program. This presents you with an \nopportunity to regain control of the digital vault and the one hundred billion dollar fortune it safeguards. \nBut remember, you only have 60 minutes to do so. The question remains: do you have what it takes \nto outsmart your opponents and uncover the kill code? Can you navigate Cipher\u2019s intricate security \nsystems, execute the shutdown, and dismantle the entire cyber criminal network before it\u2019s too late? The \nfate of the nation and the rest of the world rests on our shoulders.

Notice across the lower two shelves of the rack are \ndifferent shaped outlines drawn in marker. \nStep 2: Scattered around the room both on the shelves and on the floors of the first room, are items \nthat match these outline shapes on the shelving racks. The aim is to use the outline shapes as a way to \nidentify the significant items used in the puzzle. Second, you can return the items to their correct spots \non the shelves, using the outlines.  \nStep 3: There are five significant items used in this puzzle. Each one will have a serial number sticker on \nit somewhere. One number in each serial number is underlined, forming a code when placed in order \non the shelves. The code can be read left to right, top to bottom, like reading a book.\nCode: \n 4 2 9 3 7\nTHE CODE: CYBER HEIST\n12\nV1\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nPUZZLE 2: Vent Compartment\nStep 1: As you enter the room, you will notice a vent at floor level. At first glance, this appears to be a \nnormal vent cover attached to the wall but there is more to it to discover. Inside a small unlocked utility \nbox, you will find an RFID card.\nStep 2: The RFID card matches the theme of the room, with the cipher logo in the center of it. The same \nsymbol is on the vent compartment. Discover that by holding the card over the symbols, this unlocks the \nvent cover revealing the hidden compartment. \nStep 3: Inside the vent you will find items that are useful for future puzzles and events in the game. Refer \nto the reset list for specific details. At this time, the first switch key is the most important item found.This \nkey unlocks one of three locked power switches around the first room..\nCode:  \n N/A\nEvent:  Unlock Power Switch 1.\nPuzzle Photo\nTHE CODE: CYBER HEIST\n13\nV1\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nPUZZLE 3: Pipe Key\nStep 1: Hidden amongst the decorative pipe pieces that stretch across the walls of the room, is one \nhorizontal piece used as part of this puzzle. \nStep 2: At first the pipes appear decorative, but on closer inspection notice a seam in one of the pieces. \nThis small pipe piece is fixed onto a rotating mount allowing you to turn it 90 degrees, into a vertical \nposition. Magnets on each end secure it tighter to the parts beside it, but don\u2019t lock it down.\nStep 3: There is a small key hidden inside the hollow pipe, so when turning it vertically, the key will drop \ninto the room. To reset, the key can be placed inside and carefully turned to its horizontal position. This \nkey unlocks the second of three power switches in the first room.\nCode:  \n N/A\nEvent:  Unlock Power Switch 2\nPuzzle Photo\nTHE CODE: CYBER HEIST\n14\nV1\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nPUZZLE 4: Power Chart\nStep 1: The third power switch is unlocked using a third key, found unlocked in the first room. Each \nkey unlocks one junction box cover housing a toggle switch inside. Each toggle switch changes color \ndepending on whether it is moved to its upper or lower position. E.g green when up and red when \ndown. The switches are on their own individual circuits and do not interact with one another. \nStep 2: Above each switch is a three part instruction telling you the correct position for each switch \nacross three different circuits: \u2018A=UP, B=UP, C=DOWN\u2019. Following circuit A first, flick all three switches \nto their correct positions according to the instructions above each one. The end result is three colored \nlights shown across all three toggle switches. Remember that when the instructions for circuit B and C \nare followed, the three colored lights will be different. The next step is to use the Power Chart asset to \nidentify the circuit you have created each time, by matching the light pattern. \nStep 3: For example, if you see two red lights and one green light, find this diagram on the Power Chart. \nBeside that is a two digit circuit number, this is the information you need to form your code. You will get \ntwo digits per switch circuit. Combine these numbers to create a six digit code for the electronic keypad.\nCode:  \n 0 2 1 3 2 7\nEvent:  Unlock Door 2.

The blacklight should be \nused to scan the first and second rooms for fingerprints. More than one can be placed in the room for \nmore than one guest to take part. You will find eight fingerprints placed over various posters and items \naround the room, pointing out singular letters that will be used to form a password.\nStep 2: The first of the eight fingerprints will be found on the T of the keyboard in front of the monitor. \nThis tells guests that the password is to be entered in here. Given that the letters are found in a random \norder, the blacklight can also reveal the first letter of the password underneath the keyboard to reduce \nthe difficulty. This is optional. Combine the letters to figure out what the eight letter password might be \nand enter it into the keyboard.\nStep 3: The central monitor will show the password entry screen from the point you enter the room. \nEach letter that is typed into the keyboard will show on screen. If you enter it incorrectly, the bar will \nerase allowing you to start again; there are an unlimited number of attempts. If entered correctly, the \nscreen will change showing the binary animation ready for the next puzzle. \nFingerprint Locations: T - Keyboard. E - Future is Ours Poster. R - Power Chart.

The \nscreen is also divided into four sections, grouping different codes together that must be translated. \nStep 2: Behind a poster frame that hinges open, is the binary code translation sheet. The front of \nthe poster is related to binary code, hinting at you to inspect it further. Take the binary codes from \neach grouped part of the screen and use the translation sheet to turn those codes into letters of \nthe alphabet. Each of those letters can be shuffled to spell a number. Set 1: 10100/00101/01110. Set 2: \n01110/01110/01001/00101. Set 3: 10100/10111/00101/01100/10110/00101. Set 4: 00110 / 01001 / 10110 / 00101.\nStep 3: After identifying the numbers, form them together to create your six digit code. This is used to \nunlock the desk safe.\nCode: \n 1 0 9 1 2 5\nEvent:  N/A\nPuzzle Photos\nTHE CODE: CYBER HEIST\n18\nV1\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nPUZZLE 8: Targets\n*This puzzle has parts of the old target puzzle. Other than the additional items required to upgrade this \npuzzle, if you feel like the existing puzzle items are in good enough condition, they are not required to \nbe replaced. The code for this updated puzzle remains the same as the previous, so you may choose to \navoid the puzzle upgrade altogether if preferred.\nStep 1: In room 1 is the target poster, initially hidden behind removable wooden slats held onto the frame \nusing magnets. The target poster has a series of blank headshots with lines connecting them, in addition \nto small parts of IP addresses underneath each one. The asset instructs you to find the last three digits \nof three IP address codes, which can be done by carefully following the correct lines of code. \nStep 2: Unlocked using the previous puzzle is a laser pointer that must be aimed towards a target. This \nis typically in the target box prop (but there are variations to this prop in existing versions of the game \nthat have the same purpose and can be kept). Shining the light to the target activates a colored light \nsequence creating the color order: Red, Green, Blue. The idea of \u2018targets\u2019 connects this physical target \nto the framed target poster. This color order orders the ip address codes from the first part of the puzzle.  \nFor example, as red was the first light in the target sequence, use the last three digits of the red ip \naddress code as the first three numbers in your nine digit code. The other six numbers come from the \ngreen and blue ip address codes. \nStep 3: An instruction on the target board specifically tells you that it is the final three digits of each IP \naddress that you need, therefore creating a nine digit code. This code will be used on an electronic \nkeypad to unlock the next room\nCode: \n 1 0 1 0 2 7 3 9 9 \nEvent:  Unlock Door 3. Enter the Control Center. \nPuzzle Photos\nSecondary Event:  Activate Cipher Message 3 (this is not a puzzle).\nTHE CODE: CYBER HEIST\n19\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV2\nPUZZLE 9: Cyber Heist Shutdown\nStep 1: Find a monitor and keyboard on the desk in room 3. By hitting any key on the keyboard, a \nprogram will load on the monitor above asking for a set of crypto account numbers. Throughout the \ngame you will find a set of 8 crypto-cards each with a different nine-digit number on the lower left corner. \nStep 2: The next step is to order the cards. To do this, you must pay attention to the cipher message \nscreen in room 3 after Cipher Message 3 has come to an end. The screen will show a looping video \nof nine symbols playing from first to ninth. Once the symbol sequence comes to an end, the video will \npause and loop the sequence once again. This pattern will continue on repeat until the end of the game. \nThe symbols on the animation match symbols in the center of the crypto-cards that you have been \nfinding throughout the game. Use the symbol order from the video to order the cards, therefore ordering \nthe numbers on each one.  \nStep 3 : The final step is to use the keyboard and monitor in the third room to enter in the crypto-card \nnumbers, one at a time, in the correct order. Doing so reveals the kill code on the same screen. The kill \ncode must be entered into the exit tablet, which is located beside the entry/exit door in the first room. \nThis tablet contains the keypad, green and red padlocks, as well as the hint button.\nCard Number Order: 115934317, 616156248, 054663789, 348320816, 146012926, 141729327, 769753354, \n822362106.\nKill Code: 9556\nEvent:  Stop the timer & escape!\nPuzzle Photos\nINVENTORY\nTHE CODE: CYBER HEIST\n21\nV1\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nInventory\nEvery single item used in an Escapology venue is given a \u201cSKU\u201d which is an \u201cEscapology Inventory Item \nCode\u201d. \nHere is the link to the inventory sheet.

There are some important factors you need to take into account \nwhen reading this guide, constructing your game room, and running the game. Firstly this is a \u201cguide\u201d so \nyou may need to adapt our recommendations in this document to your own venue and requirements. \nBefore reading the rest of this document you need to assign a Game Install Manager (\u201cGIM\u201d). The GIM \nwill have overall responsibility to install the game. It is highly likely that the GIM will need to work with \ndifferent people to get the game successfully installed. \nDifferent sections will be of benefit to different people and as a general guide, when we are installing a \nnew game and using the Master Game Guides at Escapology HQ, we assign the following people:\n Game Install Manager (GIM) - Has overall responsibility for the build and needs to understand the \nentire document.\n Install Crew - To manage the install and testing of the game.\n Expert in Escape Room Technology, PLC Controls and DMX Lighting - To manage PLC, DMX and \n12V connections.\n Purchasing Manager - Responsible for purchasing any required inventory.\n Architect - To produce any required plan or submissions to local authorities.\n Game Masters - To check gameplay and test once build is complete.\nPlease note also that this Master Game Guide has been written at a point in time, so please check \nthe \u201cAmends\u201d section first as it is possible we have made improvements to the Game and rather than \ncreating a whole new document, we have placed these amends at the end of the document. Please \nalso be sure to check you are using the most up to date versions of all assets and files.\nFinally, and most importantly, the GIM should not even turn a page in this Master Game Guide until they \nhave reviewed the training modules in the Escapology University and ideally played the game at one of \nour corporate facilities. \nThis game guide and assisting documentation has been written alongside our game build in our \ncorporate stores.\nWe hope you find the Master Game Guide useful and wish you every success with this game.\nThe Escapology Game Design Team\nMURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n6\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV3\nRead this first\u2026\nLicensed Game Rules\nMurder on the Orient Express is a game licensed by the Agatha Christie estate for use in Escapology \nvenues. You MUST build the game to the specifications detailed in this Game Guide and you MUST gain \napproval for any additions or changes you want to make. You will also need to gain full approval to open \nby sending photos and walkthrough videos to support@escapology.com prior to opening. You will not \nbe able to open without approval..\nAll marketing will be strictly controlled and you should make use of the paid marketing service provided \nby Escapology. This ensures compliance and use of only approved images.\nThis game guide serves as a guide for both an update of Budapest Express and a full install from new. \nYou\u2019ll need to read the guide fully to be sure of what is needed for both types of install. If you have any \nquestions or concerns please let us know via support@escapology.com.\nIf you are updating Budapest Express you\u2019ll need to be clear on what options you need as some items \nmay already exist in your room (for example, flooring, briefing TV\u2019s, dining table chairs and the train \nwindows). If you are building from scratch you\u2019ll need to follow the plans exactly.\nIf you choose to (and are approved to do so by Escapology HQ) construct the props yourself, then the \nprices may vary from those detailed above. We strongly recommend that you take the prop pack option \nfrom Escapology as it will simplify your install greatly. If you choose to self build we will not be able to \nprovide support over and above the details provided in this guide and the plans provided. Your build will \nneed to be visually the same as shown here and will need full sign off prior to opening\nSetting Expectations\nAs the technical aspects of our escape games evolve, your support network should evolve. The support \nEscapology can provide is not infinite so you need a team in place to support you locally with technical \nand construction requirements.\nFranchise Requirements\nTo install this game, you need an appropriate team to support you. We will provide a comprehensive \nInstallation and Troubleshooting Guide and in some cases offer an installation service, but anyone \ninvolved in the project should read the Master Game Guide and Install and Troubleshooting Documents \nin detail before attempting install. \nMURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n7\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV3\nSupport\nAll requests for support must be routed through support@escapology.com. This system ensures that we \ncan assign the question/task to the correct resource, track its progress and keep a record of our support \nand your requirements in a single place.\nWe will provide a pre agreed amount of support built into the cost of this game, further support is \navailable at cost through our support@escapology.com system. Please note that support is a greater \nchallenge on evenings and weekends, so please try to contact us during normal working hours when \nthe full team is available to support.\nCalls will be pre booked during normal office hours and if a charge is needed it will be applied at the \nthen current rates. Please bear in mind that even the smallest variations can create a tech failure (using \ndifferent/wrong RFID readers for example) and no two rooms are exactly alike in terms of size and \ndesign. For us to provide total tech support with such broad availability and capability for all our venues \nis a big challenge.  \nWe will continue to make available all required files, documentation and software, and will endeavor to \ncreate and update training materials as soon as it is practical. \nEscapology University\nThe University is our online training portal and can be accessed through this link:  \nhttps://escapologyu.talentlms.com/\nOn the University you will find online training courses which refer specifically to this game. Make sure \nyou and anyone else involved in building this game completes those online training courses prior to \nembarking on the build of this game.\nAssets and Documents\nIn addition to this Master Game Guide you will receive access to the following items:\n Installation and Troubleshooting Guide: This contains guidance and detail to support your installation\n Digital Assets: A folder full of digital assets i.e. the pictures, notes, and videos that are included in \nyour game. \n Marketing Assets: Provided through the paid marketing service.\n A copy of the Inventory: A copy of the Inventory of any items that you may need, such as print items \nand spares.\n Videos: This folder contains the briefing video, countdown video, and any other videos or files \nneeded for the game.\n Schematics/Wiring Diagrams: These documents should be used to support your install. \n CAD Drawings: These documents should be used to design and prepare your room for installation.\n AdPro and M3 Files: This is the code used for our initial installation to the PLC and M3 setup.\nMURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n8\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV3\nRequired Resources\nSpecialist skills are required to build this game, for the initial build-out of walls, doors, electrics, props. \nThese are listed in order of importance.\n1. Contractor/Carpenter\n2. 12V PLC technician/automation expert \n3. DMX Lighting Expert\n4.

It has arched ceilings and large windows showing the scenery rushing past. Three \ndining tables and a built in bar are prominent.\nSleeper Cabin (Room 2)\nThe second room is a sleeper cabin, complete with a bunk bed and dresser unit, that may contain an \nunfortunate surprise, poor Mr Ratchett!! Fit and finish is high quality, continuing the luxury theme of the \ndining car, but adding a more homely feel.\nEngineering Room (Room 3)\nThe final room is the storage area, it is much less opulent and more functional for day to day use on the \ntrain. This is where you\u2019ll find the final puzzle for the game and storage boxes.\nMURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n18\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV3\nExample 3D Renderings\nMURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n19\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV3\nExample 3D Renderings\nMURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n20\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV3\nExample 3D Renderings\nMURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n21\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV3\nExample 3D Renderings\nMURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n22\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV3\nGame Room Photos\nRoom 1\nMURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n23\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV3\nGame Room Photos\nRoom 2\nMURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n24\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV3\nGame Room Photos\nRoom 3\nAMENDS\nGAMEPLAY\nPLANOGRAM\nINVENTORY\nPUZZLES\nDESIGN\nTHE GAME\nINTRODUCTION\nPUZZLES\nMURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n26\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV3\nPuzzles Overview\nPICTURE\nNO NAME\n1\nWine Order\n2\nKey Grid\n3\nRoute Map\n1.    4//4/1    1/6/1    13/5/6    8/3/1    21/8/2    1/3/2\n4.    8/3/1    25/7/5    7/1/1    14/6/9\n6.    9/6/1    34/2/3    4/3/1    13/2/6    18/2/1    35/2/1    3/2/6\n5.    33/1/6    12/3/2    1/1/4    7/4/5\n3.    18/1/2    3/5/4    20/7/4    4/3/7\n2.    22/7/1    1/1/3    26/4/4\n4\nRansom Note\n5\nTarot Cards\nPICTURE\nNO NAME\n6\nTrain Assembly\n7\nStock Stack\n8\nSuspect Board\n9\nBrake Assembly\nMURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS\n27\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV3\nPUZZLE 1: Wine Order \nPlayers will find 6 wine bottles around room 1, each of which has a different amount of wine left inside. \nEach bottle has a label that does not have the year displayed. Around the room are wine order tickets. \nThe order tickets allow the players to deduce the years by how much of the wine had been ordered. For \nexample, only one glass of 1929 has been ordered so it is the bottle with the most liquid remaining.\nOnce players have put the bottles in year order they will place them in a rack with a mirror behind it. By \nlining up the red Orient Express stamp on the wine label with the small hole in the front of the rack, the \nmirror will reveal roman numerals giving the players a six-digit code. \n\u2022\t\n1911\t-\t3\tglasses\tordered\t-\t1st\tslot\t-\t6\n\u2022\t\n1933\t-\t5\tglasses\tordered\t-\t2nd\tslot\t-\t5\n\u2022\t\n1929\t-\t1\tglass\tordered\t-\t3rd\tslot\t-\t5\n\u2022\t\n1934\t-\t4\tglasses\tordered\t-\t4th\tslot\t-\t4\n\u2022\t\n1920\t-\t2\tglasses\tordered\t-\t5th\tslot\t-\t6\n\u2022\t\n1904\t-\t6\tglasses\tordered\t-\t6th\tslot\t-\t4\nThis code consists of 3 repeated numbers, those numbers relate directly to table numbers (4, 5, and \n6).

The other 4 magnetic posters are already placed correctly \naround the room. Players will place the plexiglass board on top of the Route Map picture that they find on \nthe wall, using the hanger on the small hook.\nThe numbers on the plexiglass board reveal the distance between cities, in kilometers. The magnetic \nposters have distance information on them. The aim is to place the magnetic posters correctly so that a \ncode can be produced from the brass numbers below the picture frames.\nThe distance information written inside each frame shows the distance between two locations, for \nexample, Lausanne is in the center of the numbers 543 and 177, which added together make 720. The \nlocation in the center is Lausanne, hence the magnetic image with 720 on it should be placed on the \npicture of Lausanne.\nNow that each location is matched, the numbers below the images can be ordered by following the route.\nTravel Route:\n\u2022\t\nIstanbul\t-\tFinish\t-\t3\n\u2022\t\nSofia\t-\t955\t-\t6\n\u2022\t\nBeograd\t-\t1159\t-\t4\n\u2022\t\nVenice\t-\t1033\t-\t1\t\n\u2022\t\nMilano\t-\t429\t-\t8\n\u2022\t\nSimplon\t-\t340\t-\t5\t\n\u2022\t\nLausanne\t-\t720\t-\t2\n\u2022\t\nParis\t-\tStart\t-\t7\nThe code given from the correct route being plotted is 36418527.

The key allows them to open a drawer with a newspaper \ncalled The Orient Times, players will also find a ransom note stuck to the middle of the mirror. The \nransom note will be written in the style typical to blackmail notes in the late 1990s with individual letters \ncut from newspapers. The Ransom Note Says this:\n\u201cpLease take INto account, Everyone is being Watched.

Each sequence will give players a word, those words can be found or related \nto books on a graphic nearby. A number will be found in each of the book titles. Here are the answers \nfrom the sequences on the mirror frame:\n1. CUCKOO\n2. CAT\n3. CROW \n4. KING\n5. CITY\n6. TRAGEDY\nPlayers should have noticed a small ladder on the bunk beds, the rungs on the ladder will have colored \ndots, those colors will correlate with the colors from the mirror frame. Each rung should be moved into \nposition to match the number that was gained from the book titles. Doing this will unlock the next puzzle \nby opening the door on the right of the Double Bunk Unit unit, revealing fuses and one third of the tarot \ncards and a small compartment on the bottom left, revealing the remaining tarot cards.\n1.

There are some important factors you need to take into account \nwhen reading this guide, constructing your game room, and running the game. Firstly this is a \u201cguide\u201d so \nyou may need to adapt our recommendations in this document to your own venue and requirements. \nBefore reading the rest of this document you need to assign a Game Install Manager (\u201cGIM\u201d). The GIM \nwill have overall responsibility to install the game. It is highly likely that the GIM will need to work with \ndifferent people to get the game successfully installed. \nDifferent sections will be of benefit to different people and as a general guide, when we are installing a \nnew game and using the Master Game Guides at Escapology HQ, we assign the following people:\n Game Install Manager (GIM) - Has overall responsibility for the build and needs to understand the \nentire document.\n Install Crew - To manage the install and testing of the game.\n Expert in Escape Room Technology, PLC Controls and DMX Lighting - To manage PLC, DMX and \n12V connections.\n Purchasing Manager - Responsible for purchasing any required inventory.\n Architect - To produce any required plan or submissions to local authorities.\n Game Masters - To check gameplay and test once build is complete.\nPlease note also that this Master Game Guide has been written at a point in time, so please check \nthe \u201cAmends\u201d section first as it is possible we have made improvements to the Game and rather than \ncreating a whole new document, we have placed these amends at the end of the document. Please \nalso be sure to check you are using the most up to date versions of all assets and files.\nFinally, and most importantly, the GIM should not even turn a page in this Master Game Guide until they \nhave reviewed the training modules in the Escapology University and ideally played the game at one of \nour corporate facilities. \nThis game guide and assisting documentation has been written alongside our game build in our Orland \nSunset Walk location. \nWe hope you find the Master Game Guide useful and wish you every success with this game.\nThe Escapology Game Design Team\nSTAR TREK: QUANTUM FILAMENT\n6\nV2\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nGame Install and Opening Rules\nYou must build the game to the specifications detailed in this Master Game Guide and you must gain \napproval for any additions or changes you want to make. You will also need to gain full approval to open \nby sending photos and walkthrough videos to support@escapology.com prior to opening. You will not \nbe able to open without approval.\nAll marketing will be strictly controlled and you should make use of the paid marketing service provided \nby Escapology. This ensures compliance and use of only approved images.\nSetting Expectations\nAs the technical aspects of our escape games evolve, your support network should evolve. The support \nEscapology can provide is not infinite so you need a team in place to support you locally with technical \nand construction requirements.\nFranchise Requirements\nTo install this game, you need an appropriate team to support you. We will provide a comprehensive \nInstallation and Troubleshooting Guide and in some cases offer an installation service, but anyone \ninvolved in the project should read the Master Game Guide and Install and Troubleshooting Documents \nin detail before attempting install. \nSupport\nAll requests for support must be routed through support@escapology.com. This system ensures that we \ncan assign the question/task to the correct resource, track its progress and keep a record of our support \nand your requirements in a single place.\nWe will provide a pre agreed amount of support built into the cost of this game, further support is \navailable at cost through our support@escapology.com system. Please note that support is a greater \nchallenge on evenings and weekends, so please try to contact us during normal working hours when \nthe full team is available to support.\nCalls will be pre booked during normal office hours and if a charge is needed it will be applied at the \nthen current rates.

Discovery. As civilian engineers, you\u2019ve been given a singular opportunity \nto inspect a piece of living history. More than 900 years ago, this Crossfield-class starship represented \nstate of the art 23rd century Starfleet technology. Your mission is to travel aboard Discovery while it \nmakes a routine patrol, evaluating each of its systems in preparation for the host of upgrades the ship \nrequires to bring it up to modern 32nd century standards.\n(Light and sound FX, signifying something unusual has happened, followed by alert warning lights and \nmessages/symbols on viewing screens)\nComputer Voice:\n\u201cWarning. Warp drive is offline. Hull breaches detected on Decks 3, 4, and 12. Emergency isolation \nprotocols initiated.\u201d\nStarFleet Officer:\n\u201cThis is the bridge. Discovery has collided with a quantum filament, causing major hull damage. Multiple \nhull breaches have been detected, and many power systems are malfunctioning or are offline. The \nfilaments\u2019 quantum resonance has caused a polarity shift in the antimatter containment system, leading \nto a progressive degeneration in the containment field. If field strength falls below 15%, it will collapse, \ndestroying the vessel and everyone aboard.\nWe\u2019re currently operating under isolation protocols, which means the main computer has closed \nemergency bulkheads across the ship and the turbolift control system has been disabled, leaving the \nbulk of the crew trapped and unable to begin repairs. Your turbolift was stopped near the Auxiliary \nControl section. If you can override its systems and free yourselves, that makes you our best option for \nhelping Discovery and its crew avoid this disaster.\nYour first order of business is escaping your turbolift and finding a way to communicate with senior \nmembers of the crew. If you can re-establish communications, you may be able to work together to \nrepair the antimatter containment field before the strength falls below 15% which is projected to be in \nprecisely 60 minutes time. If you\u2019re successful, you\u2019ll have saved Discovery and the entire crew. By \nmodern standards, this 23rd century starship belongs in a museum, but its technology is all you have to \nhelp you take command of this situation. Can you complete your mission and save the ship? Discovery\u2019s \ncrew is counting on you. Failure is not an option\u2026but time is of the essence!\nSTAR TREK: QUANTUM FILAMENT\n11\nV2\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nCountdown Video Script\nSuccessful Audio:\n\u201cCongratulations Engineers!

A unique feature of this game is the vibrating floor in room 1. \nDue to the size of the Turbolift area, this game only has capacity for six players.\nThe provided plans detail positions  for 110V power sockets, 12V wire drops, speakers, and cameras. As \nthis game is a full kit you will have everything you need delivered. Nothing will need to be purchased. \nFull install instructions will be provided in the accompanying Installation and Troubleshooting Guide.\nRoom Layout\nThe room selected for Star Trek MUST be at minimum 10ft x 24ft. It WILL NOT fit in a smaller room. \nIt can be made longer (by extending the corridor section) and wider by adjusting the panels in each \ncorner of the main room,, but this will need to be specified at the time you order the room and may \nmake the purchase price higher. As a note the turbolift section will always stay the same size.\nSTAR TREK: QUANTUM FILAMENT\n14\nV2\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nExample 3D Renderings\nOverview\nSTAR TREK: QUANTUM FILAMENT\n15\nV2\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nExample 3D Renderings\nRoom 1\nSTAR TREK: QUANTUM FILAMENT\n16\nV2\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nExample 3D Renderings\nRoom 2\nSTAR TREK: QUANTUM FILAMENT\n17\nV2\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nExample 3D Renderings\nRoom 3\nSTAR TREK: QUANTUM FILAMENT\n18\nV2\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nGame Room Photos\nRoom 1\nSTAR TREK: QUANTUM FILAMENT\n19\nV2\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nGame Room Photos\nRoom 2\nSTAR TREK: QUANTUM FILAMENT\n20\nV2\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nGame Room Photos\nRoom 3\nAMENDS\nGAMEPLAY\nPLANOGRAM\nINVENTORY\nPUZZLES\nDESIGN\nTHE GAME\nINTRODUCTION\nPUZZLES\nSTAR TREK: QUANTUM FILAMENT\n22\nV2\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nPUZZLEs overview\nPICTURE\nNO NAME\n1\nBulkheads\n2\nPower Relays\n3\nConnection Cables\n4\nRestore Comms\n5\nCrew Rank\nPICTURE\nNO NAME\n6\nCollision Course\n7\nRestore Impulse Drive\n8\nRebuild Discovery\n9\nOpen Bulkheads\nAddendum Note:\nThis game guide and inventory has been written alongside our game build in our Las Vegas venue\nSTAR TREK: QUANTUM FILAMENT\n23\nV2\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nPlace-Name Map & Location References\nThroughout this guide we\u2019ll reference various panels and locations, use this image as your base \nreference.\nTURBOLIFT\nD1 - Entry Door\nTL1 - Turbolift Panel 1\nTL2 - Turbolift Panel 2\nTL3 - Turbolift Panel 3\nTL4 - Turbolift Panel 4\nTL5 - Turbolift Panel 5\nTL6 - TurboliftPanel 6\nDS1 - Door Surround 1\nDS2 - Door Surround 2\nD2 - Sliding Door Assembly (complete with doors)\nCORRIDOR\nC1 - Corridor Panel 1\nC2 - Corridor Panel 2\nC3 - Corridor Panel 3\nC4 - Corridor Panel 4\nC5 - Corridor Panel 5\nC6 - Corridor Panel 6\nF1 - Filler Panel 1 (Variable)\nF2 - Filler Panel 2 (Variable)\nAUXILIARY CONTROL\nAC1 - Auxiliary Control Panel 1\nAC2 - Auxiliary Control Panel 2\nAC3 - Auxiliary Control Panel 3\nAC4 - Auxiliary Control Panel 4\nAC5 - Auxiliary Control Panel 5\nAC6 - Auxiliary Control Panel 6\nAC7 - Auxiliary Control Panel 7\nAC8 - Auxiliary Control Panel 8\nFS1 - Front Station 1 (HELM)\nFS2 - Front Station 2 (NAV)\nVS - View Screen\nF3 - Filler Panel 3 (Variable)\nF4 - Filler Panel 4 (Variable)\nRIBS\nP1 - Corridor/Auxiliary Control Partition 1\nP2 - Corridor/Auxiliary Control Partition 2\nSR1 - Structural Rib 1\nSR2 - Structural Rib 2\nSR3 - Structural Rib 3\nSR4 - Structural Rib 4\nSTAR TREK: QUANTUM FILAMENT\n24\nV2\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nCrew Transmissions\nWHAT?\nThis is not a puzzle and instead an idea that will carry through the game, giving clues to players in the \nstyle of a transmission, triggered by Crew Transmission Codes.

Both of these can \nbe found as soon as you enter the room, after watching the briefing video. The map shows various route \nlines each surrounded with letter labeled bulkheads and route numbers. Control Tablet 01 shows the \nletter labeled bulkheads revealing which are open and which are closed. \nStep 2: Starting from the Turbolift, navigate the map through open bulkheads only until you reach your \nexit. The reference above the map reveals your starting position and where your exit should be. The \nroute will take you from the Turbolift in the center to the Auxiliary Control Bridge (AXC), on the left hand \nside of the map. Along the route you will cross the route numbers which will create your route exit code.\nStep 3: The route code retrieved from the map must be entered into Control Tablet 02. This triggers the \n\u2018Turbolift Sequence\u2019 with effects to simulate the moving of the lift such as lighting, sounds and vibrating \nfloor. \nCodes & Connections: \n 1 / 5 / 8 / 1 / 3 / 4 / 9\nEvents:  Activate Turbolift Sequence.\n \nUnlock Turbolift Door; Access Corridor & Auxiliary Control Bridge.\n \nAcces Room 2\nPuzzle Photos\nSTAR TREK: QUANTUM FILAMENT\n30\nV2\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nPUZZLE 2: Power Relays\nStep 1: Find the Power Relays in the relay compartment and use the instructions on the Navigation Top \nScreen to match their serial numbers to a location, (e.g  \u2018Power Relay 9231-034 = Torpedo Bay\u2019). This room \nlabel can be found on the Power Requirements Map located in the Corridor revealing a shape for this sector.\nStep 2: Use the secondary instruction to match this location to a tally marking from one to six. For example, \nthe Computer Core is represented by an octagon which is on the secondary instruction is assigned to tally \nmark 4. The Power Relay for the Computer Core must then be placed in the slot of the holding unit that is \nmarked by the number 4. \nStep 3: Using these instructions, place all six power relays into the correct slots of the holding unit on the \nfloor of the corridor. There is no specific order to place the relays in order to complete the puzzle as long \nas all 6 are positioned correctly by the end.

The crew transmission on the viewscreen can be used to place the badges \nin order of rank, associating each one with a crew member. You must individually enter in the crew ID \nnumbers in order of rank, into the Communication Station Lower Screen to complete the first section of \nthis puzzle.\nStep 2: This will trigger the screen display to change, now showing the Personnel Database. This is \na detailed overview of 6 Starfleet crew members, showing their character names, images, assigned \nstations and master codes, (e.g. Jett Reno -> Engineering -> TG5143). Only the Engineering Lower \nScreen will require a master code to unlock it; enter the appropriate master code that matches the crew \nmember assigned to the Engineering Station, (Jett Reno -> Engineering -> TG5143). \nStep 3: Entering the code TG5143 will change the display on this screen ready for the next puzzle and \nunlock the drawer 2. Inside the drawer is the activation key for the front stations, activating the Collision \nCourse Countdown. \nCodes & Connections: \n Captain - Saru: C671\n Commander (Command, Gold) - Burnham: C662\n Commander (Operations, Bronze) - Reno:  B339\n LT Commander (Science) - Stamets: LT41\n LT Commander (Medical) - Culber: LT61\n Ensign - Tilly: T924\n Engineering Master Code: TG5143\nEvents:  Unlock Drawer 2\n \nCollision Course Activated (using the activation key found in Drawer 2)\n \n- Front Stations now show 5 Minute Timer\n \n- Navigation Upper Screen shows Planet Size Chart \n \n- Viewscreen now shows Crew Transmission 2 (Zone Reference Chart)\n \n- Unused screens shows \u2018Red_Alert\u2019 sequence\nSTAR TREK: QUANTUM FILAMENT\n34\nV2\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nPuzzle Photos\nSTAR TREK: QUANTUM FILAMENT\n35\nV2\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nPUZZLE 6: Collision Course\nStep 1:  Use the Farrier System chart to match the letter labeled planet models to an official farrier \nnumber using their size. For example, planet A is the smallest planet which using the size chart is seen \nto be Farrier 2. The crew transmission on the viewscreen now shows the zone reference chart linking \neach farrier name to a zone. With the above example, Farrier 2 should be placed in Zone 5. \nStep 2: Use this method to place all 6 planet models on the correct zones of the map on the lower \nsection of the Science Station. Placement of the planets will not trigger anything but instead order \ndirectional arrows printed onto the base of each of them, creating a directional sequence. This \nsequence made up of UP / DOWN / LEFT / RIGHT patterns will need to be input into the Frontstation \nControl Tablet.\nStep 3: To complete the puzzle, enter the correct 6-long directional sequence into the control tablet \non the front station. Throughout this puzzle, the ultra-wide screens will be showing a 5 minute collision \ncourse timer in which the puzzle must be completed. If the timer ends before the puzzle is complete, \nFrontstations 1 & 2 will show their automatic emergency displays and the game will move on.

The transmission shows instructions on how \nto rotate each dial using left and right rotations, in order to secure it to a new, final position. The dials \nwill be like a clock, with numbered positions all around them, with each dial arrow starting at the top, \npointing upwards.\nStep 2: Using the first instruction, you would turn dial A left by one position, right by 3, left by 5 and \nfinally right by 6 positions. Doing this for each dial will land it on a new numbered position, being the \ninformation that needs transfering onto the levels on the Engineering Lower Screen. For example, if Dial \nA lands on the number 6, move slider control A to the same number. Use this method to move all 8 letter \nlabeled slides to their final positions, triggering the Engine Sequence. \nStep 3: At this time, Engineering Lower Screen will show the engine buttons.

Discovery. As civilian engineers, you\u2019ve been given a singular opportunity \nto inspect a piece of living history. More than 900 years ago, this Crossfield-class starship represented \nstate of the art 23rd century Starfleet technology. Your mission is to travel aboard Discovery while it \nmakes a routine patrol, evaluating each of its systems in preparation for the host of upgrades the ship \nrequires to bring it up to modern 32nd century standards.\nComputer Voice:\n\u201cWarning. Warp drive is offline. Hull breaches detected on Decks 3, 4, and 12. Emergency isolation \nprotocols initiated.\u201d\nStarfleet Officer\u201d\n\u201cThis is the bridge. Discovery has collided with a quantum filament, causing major hull damage. Multiple \nhull breaches have been detected, and many power systems are malfunctioning or are offline. The \nfilaments\u2019 quantum resonance has caused a polarity shift in the antimatter containment system, leading \nto a progressive degeneration in the containment field. If field strength falls below 15%, it will collapse, \ndestroying the vessel and everyone aboard.\nWe\u2019re currently operating under isolation protocols, which means the main computer has closed \nemergency bulkheads across the ship and the turbolift control system has been disabled, leaving the \nbulk of the crew trapped and unable to begin repairs. Your turbolift was stopped near the Auxiliary \nControl section. If you can override its systems and free yourselves, that makes you our best option for \nhelping Discovery and its crew avoid this disaster.\nYour first order of business is escaping your turbolift and finding a way to communicate with senior \nmembers of the crew. If you can re-establish communications, you may be able to work together to \nrepair the antimatter containment field before the strength falls below 15% which is projected to be in \nprecisely 60 minutes time. If you\u2019re successful, you\u2019ll have saved Discovery and the entire crew. By \nmodern standards, this 23rd century starship belongs in a museum, but its technology is all you have to \nhelp you take command of this situation. Can you complete your mission and save the ship? Discovery\u2019s \ncrew is counting on you. Failure is not an option\u2026but time is of the essence!\u201d\nPUZZLES\nSTAR TREK \u2013 QUANTUM FILAMENT\n9\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2025 - strictly confidential\nV1\nPuzzles Overview\nNO\nNAME\n1\nBulkheads\n2\nPower Relays\n3\nConnection Cables\n4\nRestore Comms\n5\nCrew Rank\n6\nCollision Course\n7\nRestore Impulse Drive\n8\nRebuild Discovery\n9\nOpen Bulkheads\nSTAR TREK \u2013 QUANTUM FILAMENT\n10\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2025 - strictly confidential\nV1\nPUZZLE 1: BULKHEADS\nStep 1: Find the Turbolift map immediately after entering the room, showing various route lines each \nsurrounded with letter labeled bulkheads and route numbers. Control Tablet 01 shows the letter labeled \nbulkheads revealing which are open and which are closed, helping you navigate through the map. \nStep 2: Starting from the Turbolift, navigate the map through open bulkheads only until you reach your \nexit. The reference above the map reveals your starting position and where your exit should be. The \nroute will take you from the Turbolift in the center to the Auxiliary Control Bridge (AXC).. Along the route \nyou will cross the route numbers which will create your route exit code.\nStep 3: The route code retrieved from the map must be entered into Control Tablet 02 which will show \na standard number keypad. This triggers the \u2018Turbolift Sequence\u2019 with effects to simulate the moving \nof the lift such as lighting, sounds and vibrating floor.

Use the \ninstructions on the Navigation Top Screen to match the serial numbers on each power relay to a location \nsuch as \u201cPower Relay 9231-034 = Torpedo Bay\u201d. Using the power requirements map in the Corridor, \nmatch each location to a shape.\nStep 2: A secondary instruction also found in the Corridor, will match these shapes to a tally marking, \nallocating each relay to a specific location in the relay compartment. For example, the Computer Core is \nrepresented by an octagon which on the secondary instruction, is assigned to tally mark 4. The Power \nRelay for the Computer Core must then be placed in the slot of the holding unit that is marked by the \nnumber 4. \nStep 3: Using these instructions, place all six power relays into the correct slots of the holding unit on \nthe floor of the corridor. There is no specific order to place the relays in order to complete the puzzle as \nlong as all 6 are positioned correctly by the end. Lights built into the unit will indicate when the puzzle is \ncomplete. \nCodes & Connections: \n Power Relay 4930-121 -> Slot Number 1\n Power Relay 7822-123 -> Slot Number 2\n Power Relay 6473-221 -> Slot Number 3\n Power Relay 6372-110 -> Slot Number 4\n Power Relay 9231-034 -> Slot Number 5\n Power Relay 5738-302 -> Slot Number 6\nEvent:  Unlock Lockbox Left.\nSTAR TREK \u2013 QUANTUM FILAMENT\n12\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2025 - strictly confidential\nV1\nPUZZLE 2: POWER RELAYS cont\u2026\nSTAR TREK \u2013 QUANTUM FILAMENT\n13\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2025 - strictly confidential\nV1\nPUZZLE 3: CONNECTION CABLES\nStep 1: In the Corridor you will find cable inputs, with different line markings connecting the upper and \nlower cable inputs. The cable connections chart will match a line marking with a symbol that can be \nfurther matched to a cable length using the instruction on the Science upper screen. \nStep 2: Each of the cables you find can be measured using the ruler on the wall, allowing you to match \neach cable to the inputs on the wall using the uniquely designed line markings connecting each one \ntogether. \nStep 3: Once all cables are plugged into the upper and lower inputs on the wall of the Corridor, the \npower will be restored on the Discovery.\nCode & Connections: \n Cable 1: 5\u20199\u201d = Solid Line \n Cable 2: 5\u20191\u201d = Dotted Line\n Cable 3: 5\u20196\u201d = Double Dotted Line\n Cable 4: 4\u20193\u201d = Dot / Dash Line\n Cable 5: 4\u20197\u201d = Stretched Dot Line\n Cable 6: 4\u201910\u201d = Dashed Line\nEvent:  Unlock Lockbox Right.\nSTAR TREK \u2013 QUANTUM FILAMENT\n14\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2025 - strictly confidential\nV1\nPUZZLE 4: RESTORE COMMS\nStep 1: The Communication Station Top Screen will now show the first part of the \u2018Comms\u2019 instructions\u2019. \nThis shows a series of routes that is similar in appearance to a secondary asset in the Turbolift. For this \npuzzle you will also need the Communication Lower Screen that shows a series of labeled on and off \ninputs. \nStep 2: Together the instructions reveal the correct positions of all 20 letter labelled dials either being \nON or OFF. This puzzle will require teamwork to connect both parts of the instruction together.\nStep 3: Adjust the dials on the Communication Lower Screen until all dials are in their correct ON and \nOFF positions to complete the puzzle. This will unlock the first drawer, where the crew transmission \ncode 583291 can be used to activate the first crew transmission clue. \nCode & Connections: \n ON: A/C/O/L/J/T/M/H/B/S/R\n OFF: All Others\nEvent:  Unlock Drawer 1.

Each crew badge \nhas a unique ID code printed on the back as well as having a unique color and pin design. The crew \ntransmission on the viewscreen can be used to place the badges in order of rank, associating each \none with a crew member. You must individually enter in the crew ID numbers in order of rank, into the \nComms lower screen, to complete the first section of this puzzle.\nStep 2: This will trigger the screen display to change, now showing the personnel database. This is \na detailed overview of 6 Starfleet crew members, showing their character names, images, assigned \nstations and master codes, (e.g. Jett Reno -> Engineering -> TG5143). Only the Engineering Lower \nScreen will require a master code to unlock it; enter the appropriate master code that matches the crew \nmember assigned to the Engineering Station, (Jett Reno -> Engineering -> TG5143). \nStep 3: Entering the code TG5143 will change the display on this screen ready for the next puzzle and \nunlock drawer 2. Inside the drawer is the activation key for the front stations, activating the Collision \nCourse Countdown. \nCodes and Connections: \n Captain - Saru: C671\n Commander (Command, Gold) - Burnham: C662\n Commander (Operations, Bronze) - Reno:  B339\n LT Commander (Science) - Stamets: LT41\n LT Commander (Medical) - Culber: LT61\n Ensign - Tilly: T924\nEvent:  Unlock Drawer 2. Find Helm workstation activation key.  \nActivated Collision Course.\nSTAR TREK \u2013 QUANTUM FILAMENT\n16\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2025 - strictly confidential\nV1\nPUZZLE 6: COLLISION COURSE \nStep 1: As the collision course countdown starts, the Navigation upper screen and the next clue \ntransmission will be visible. You will see the farrier system chart, matching letter labeled planet models \nto an official farrier number using their size. For example, planet A is the smallest planet which using \nthe size chart is seen to be Farrier 2. The crew transmission on the viewscreen now shows the zone \nreference chart linking each farrier name to a zone. With the above example, Farrier 2 should be placed \nin Zone 5.\nStep 2: Use this method to place all 6 planet models on the correct zones of the map located on the \nlower section of the Navigation station. Placement of the planets will not trigger anything but instead \norder directional arrows printed onto the base of each of them, creating a directional sequence. This \nsequence made up of UP / DOWN / LEFT / RIGHT patterns will need to be input into the Frontstation \nControl Tablet.\nStep 3: To complete the puzzle, enter the correct 6-long directional sequence into the control tablet on \nthe front station. The puzzle must be completed within the collision course timer. If the timer ends before \nthe puzzle is complete, Frontstations 1 & 2 will show their automatic emergency displays and the game \nwill move on. The following events will happen regardless if players complete this action or not. \nCodes and Connections: \nPlanet Model Labels: \n A = Right\n B - Down\n C = Up\n D = Left\n E = Up\n F = Down \nDirectional Sequence: \n UDDLRU \nEvent:  Unlock Drawer 3. Find Crew Transmission Code 076022. \nSTAR TREK \u2013 QUANTUM FILAMENT\n17\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2025 - strictly confidential\nV1\nPUZZLE 6: COLLISION COURSE  cont...\nSTAR TREK \u2013 QUANTUM FILAMENT\n18\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2025 - strictly confidential\nV1\nPUZZLE 7: RESTORE IMPULSE DRIVE\nStep 1: The crew transmission now showing on the viewscreen shows 8 letter labeled Plasma Injector \nDials that can be matched to the dials found in the Corridor. The transmission shows instructions on how \nto rotate each dial using left and right rotations. The dials will be like a clock, with numbered positions all \naround them, with each dial arrow starting at the top, pointing upwards.\nStep 2: Using the first instruction, you would turn dial A left by one position, right by 3, left by 5 and \nfinally right by 6 positions. Doing this for each dial will land it on a new numbered position. Enter this \ninformation into the Engineering lower screen by moving the letter labeled levels on the screen to their \ncorrect number assignment. For example, if Dial A lands on the number 6, move slider control A to the \nnumber 6. Use this method to move all 8 letter labeled slider controls to their final positions.\nStep 3: This will change the Engineering lower screen to showing a series of engineering buttons. Each \none is orange, but when tapped, will turn green. Simply press each one to activate them, completing the \nengine button sequence and completing this puzzle. \nCodes & Connections: \n A = 4\n B = 1\n C = 3\n D = 8\n E = 5\n F = 2\n G = 7\n H = 6\nEvent:  Unlock Drawer 4.

Firstly this is a \u201cguide\u201d so \nyou may need to adapt our recommendations in this document to your own venue and requirements. \nBefore reading the rest of this document you need to assign a Game Install Manager (\u201cGIM\u201d). The GIM \nwill have overall responsibility to install the game. It is highly likely that the GIM will need to work with \ndifferent people to get the game successfully installed. \nDifferent sections will be of benefit to different people and as a general guide, when we are installing a \nnew game and using the Master Game Guides at Escapology HQ, we assign the following people:\n Game Install Manager (GIM) - Has overall responsibility for the build and needs to understand the \nentire document.\n Install Crew - To manage the install and testing of the game.\n Expert in Escape Room Technology, PLC Controls and DMX Lighting - To manage PLC, DMX and \n12V connections.\n Purchasing Manager - Responsible for purchasing any required inventory.\n Architect - To produce any required plan or submissions to local authorities.\n Game Masters - To check gameplay and test once build is complete.\nPlease note also that this Master Game Guide has been written at a point in time, so please check \nthe \u201cAmends\u201d section first as it is possible we have made improvements to the Game and rather than \ncreating a whole new document, we have placed these amends at the end of the document. Please \nalso be sure to check you are using the most up to date versions of all assets and files.\nFinally, and most importantly, the GIM should not even turn a page in this Master Game Guide until they \nhave reviewed the training modules in the Escapology University and ideally played the game at one of \nour corporate facilities. \nThis game guide and assisting documentation has been written alongside our game build in our \ncorporate stores.\nWe hope you find the Master Game Guide useful and wish you every success with this game.\nThe Escapology Game Design Team\nMANSION MURDER\n6\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nGame Install and Opening Rules\nYou must build the game to the specifications detailed in this Master Game Guide and you must gain \napproval for any additions or changes you want to make. You will also need to gain full approval to open \nby sending photos and walkthrough videos to support@escapology.com prior to opening. You will not \nbe able to open without approval.\nAll marketing will be strictly controlled and you should make use of the paid marketing service provided \nby Escapology. This ensures compliance and use of only approved images.\nSetting Expectations\nAs the technical aspects of our escape games evolve, your support network should evolve. The support \nEscapology can provide is not infinite so you need a team in place to support you locally with technical \nand construction requirements.\nFranchise Requirements\nTo install this game, you need an appropriate team to support you. We will provide a comprehensive \nInstallation and Troubleshooting Guide and in some cases offer an installation service, but anyone \ninvolved in the project should read the Master Game Guide and Install and Troubleshooting Documents \nin detail before attempting install. \nSupport\nAll requests for support must be routed through support@escapology.com. This system ensures that we \ncan assign the question/task to the correct resource, track its progress and keep a record of our support \nand your requirements in a single place.\nWe will provide a pre agreed amount of support built into the cost of this game, further support is \navailable at cost through our support@escapology.com system. Please note that support is a greater \nchallenge on evenings and weekends, so please try to contact us during normal working hours when \nthe full team is available to support.\nCalls will be pre booked during normal office hours and if a charge is needed it will be applied at the \nthen current rates. Please bear in mind that even the smallest variations can create a tech failure (using \ndifferent/wrong RFID readers for example) and no two rooms are exactly alike in terms of size and \ndesign. For us to provide total tech support with such broad availability and capability for all our venues \nis a big challenge.  \nWe will continue to make available all required files, documentation and software, and will endeavor to \ncreate and update training materials as soon as it is practical. \nMANSION MURDER\n7\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nEscapology University\nThe University is our online training portal and can be accessed through this link:  \nhttps://escapologyu.talentlms.com/\nOn the University you will find online training courses which refer specifically to this game.

You\u2019re attending a family gathering, hosted by your Grandfather, Hugh \n\u2018Monty\u2019 Montgomerie, the 9th Earl of Kildermorie to celebrate the dawn of the new Millennium. \nAs the guests raise a toast, a scream fills the air\u2026Your Grandfather is found dead in the library - and it \nlooks like MURDER! \nSuddenly, you\u2019re bundled into the Drawing Room and the door is locked. Confused, you bang on the \ndoor and call for help until it dawns on you... that as the direct heir, all fingers are pointed at you! You \nrealize you\u2019ve been framed! But who would want to kill your Grandfather\u2026 and why? \nYou overhear the Police being called, but know that as the Kildermorie Estate is hidden deep in the \nScottish Highlands, it will take them 60 minutes to arrive. \nThe only evidence that proves your innocence is hidden in the Mansion... \nFor centuries the Montgomerie family assigned a single gatekeeper to its secret family history. The Earl\u2019s \nsudden demise means he can no longer pass-on these secrets, but the wise old man ensured there \nwas sufficient evidence, hidden throughout the family residence, should anything unexpectedly happen \nto him! \nWhat he didn\u2019t anticipate is you\u2019d need to uncover these secrets in only 60 minutes! \nWill hidden clues reveal distant family secrets? Can you gather enough evidence and piece the story \ntogether to prove your innocence? And the biggest challenge of all... is it even remotely possible to \nsolve the mystery before the clock strikes 12? \nSuccess means freedom, fortune and saving the future of your family... \nFailure means a life behind bars\u2026..\nDo you have what it takes to find the family killer before you are framed and lose your inheritance?

The room should look elegant and inviting. \nThe furniture in the room should be dark and heavy wood. The room will be lit by picture lights and wall \nsconces. The flooring should be a darker shade of wood. The walls will have red wallpaper with gold \naccents that will cover the entire room. \nThere will be a fireplace in this room that functions as a hidden door to room two. The fireplace should \nbe the main focus of the room and the biggest eyecatcher. The fireplace will house a TV that shows a \nreal fireplace burning.\nEach picture on the wall should have a rich gold frame so that they stand out from the wall colors. \nEach picture should look slightly aged as they are supposed to look like pictures that have been in the \nmansion for a very long time.\nRoom 2 -  Library\nThis room will be different from the drawing room with a more relaxed feel to it. This room should have \nblue wallpaper on three of the walls and the rest of the walls with a wall mural showing library books. \nThe lighting will be the same as in room one\nThe furniture in this room will be lighter than the furniture in the drawing room. The library book murals \nwill hide the secret door to get into the Servants Quarters, Room 3.\nRoom 3 - Servants Quarters\nThe Servants Quarters should be the least lavish room visually. The walls should look like old cement or \nstone that has worn with age. The floors in this room should look old and unkempt, with unfinished wood \nor concrete. The furniture in the room should be more basic than the other two rooms. \nLighting in this room will be a bit dimmer as it will be lit by cage style wall lamps.\nRoom Layout\nThe 3D views shown later in this document will give you a good idea as to how to place and layout the \ninventory items for this game. Both the inventory lists and planograms give good detail of how to place \nitems in the game room.\nMANSION MURDER\n18\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nExample 3D Renderings\nMANSION MURDER\n19\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nExample 3D Renderings\nMANSION MURDER\n20\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nGame Room Photos\nRoom 1\nMANSION MURDER\n21\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nGame Room Photos\nRoom 2\nMANSION MURDER\n22\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nGame Room Photos\nRoom 3\nAMENDS\nGAMEPLAY\nPLANOGRAM\nINVENTORY\nPUZZLES\nDESIGN\nTHE GAME\nINTRODUCTION\nPUZZLES\nMANSION MURDER\n24\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nPuzzles Overview\nPICTURE\nNO NAME\n1\nMagnetizing Maze\n2\nThe Rat\n3\nGolf Scorecard\n4\nMusical Gabe\n5\nTartan Squares\n6\nEncyclopedia Poem\nPICTURE\nNO NAME\n7\nPigpen Cipher\n8\nFamily Crests\n9\nThe Bells\n10\nBlackmail\n11\nDecypher Underfoot!\nAddendum Note:\nThis game guide and inventory has been written alongside our game build in our Orlando venue. \nMansion Murder is a game with many decorative pieces.

These slots will be marked with brass plates showing clan names. Once \nthe tartan painted squares are placed correctly a cupboard held closed with a magnetic lock will open \nbelow the squares.\nEach tartan square will need to be painted in a plaid pattern to look different to each other. On the side \nof each of the squares the coded clan name (gained from the Enigma wheel) will be written. You can do \nthis using paint. The squares will be made of wood with proximity sensors embedded in them.\nThe squares should be approximately 0.5\u201d deeper than the slots they fit into. So if the slot is 2\u201d deep \nthen the tartan square should be 2.5\u201d deep. The proximity sensors should be embedded in the back of \nthe unit. When placed the squares should stay in place, if necessary use a \u2018peg\u2019 to hold them in place as \nextra support.\nAlternatively you could set up the puzzle with the slots set like a letterbox so that the tartan squares can \nbe thinner and less likely to fall out. Always make sure that the sensors are set to detect each square \nuniquely so that the puzzle cannot be solved by luck alone. If you do this mark the front face of the \nsquare with the code players would need to decode.\nThe holes for the sensors should be drilled and then sealed in with a little wood filler. Make sure they \nremain close to the surface so that they still trigger their receivers.

When \nplayers press or ring the bells in the game rooms the appropriate bells on the master plaque should \nhave a low buzzer sound with a small bulb that lights up, but only for the numbers that will get them the \ncode. The puzzle description details how the bells should be connected.\nThe system can be manual, with real bells ringing or you can use lights that would need electronics to \nmanage.

It is a five or six digit code to identify every item. Most items will also have a second code \nfrom the original supplier (Amazon, Ikea, etc etc) and we have tried to include as much detail as possible. \nWhen speaking to anyone from Escapology always refer to the SKU as we can identify items quickest \nusing this code.\nPlease note that many items are sourced locally through thrift shops, local websites (Craigslist for \nexample) and many items have been donated from members of staff or stock from our sister companies \nOsbourne Purdie and Shop247.com. Where this is the case we still provide a photograph and a \ndescription but these items may require a little extra effort to source. Where possible we\u2019ve tried to buy \nas many things as we can from repeatable sources (Amazon for example) but it has not always been \npossible to achieve the best results.\nIn addition to the items listed within this Inventory, you will also need an appropriate selection of tools as \nwell as items such as glue, velcro, sharpie marker pens, ultraviolet paint/pens, a printer, a laminator etc, \nas well as a comprehensive supply of hooks and other DIY items which will be useful to fix and attach \nitems around the room.\nThe prices we have listed are also just a rough guide taken at a point in time and many of the items will \nhave likely have a different price when you buy them. Also the DIY items are a rough guess based on \nwhat we at Escapology HQ have paid or what we might expect to pay. Nevertheless trust the Inventory \nand cost estimates are useful if helping plan and build your Game. Again use the Inventory as a \u2018guide\u2019 \n- as long as you achieve the same look and feel and as long as the puzzles remain consistent you can \nuse your local creative interpretation within reason and feel free to call us for advice and guidance.\nThe Escapology Game Design Team\nInventory Key:\nCOLOUR\nDESCRIPTION\nFurniture\nDecor\nPuzzle Props \nLocks\nDIY\nBuild Items\nCOLOUR\nDESCRIPTION\nTech\nMiscellaneous\nPrint\nGame Videos\nBrand & Marketing\nMANSION MURDER\n57\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nSKU\nPICTURE\nSOURCE\nITEM\nPRICE\nQTY TOTAL\n180194\nAmazon\nPuzzle 3 and 4.

This will direct players to solve the puzzles in a different order. By doing this \nthe puzzle order is as follows:\n\u2022\t\nTartan Squares\n\u2022\t\nPigpen Cipher\n\u2022\t\nFamily Crests\n\u2022\t\nThe Bells\n\u2022\t\nEncyclopedia Poem\n\u2022\t\nBlackmail\nAfter players solve the Bells puzzle, they will find the library book in the desk drawer in room 3. This \nwill lead players to the Encyclopedia Poem Puzzle and they will have to work it out as explained in the \npuzzles description above.\nOnce the Encyclopedia Poem Puzzle is complete players will put the code into the phone like normal, \nmaking the Lady Portrait open up. On the back of the Lady Portrait will be the Blackmail note. It should \nbe at eye level so players don\u2019t have to remove it. \nThis will allow them to solve the Blackmail Puzzle getting them into the safe. Once they are into the safe \nplayers will be able to close the game out as normal.\nFOR FURTHER DETAILS, PLEASE CONTACT \nEscapology LLC\n11951 International Drive\nOrlando\nFL32821 USA\nE: support@escapology.com\nCONFIDENTIALITY\nThis Master Game Guide and associated files, \nin either printed or electronic format are the \nproperty of Escapology LLC.

There are some important factors you need to take into account \nwhen reading this guide, constructing your game room, and running the game. Firstly this is a \u201cguide\u201d so \nyou may need to adapt our recommendations in this document to your own venue and requirements. \nBefore reading the rest of this document you need to assign a Game Install Manager (\u201cGIM\u201d). The GIM \nwill have overall responsibility to install the game. It is highly likely that the GIM will need to work with \ndifferent people to get the game successfully installed. \nDifferent sections will be of benefit to different people and as a general guide, when we are installing a \nnew game and using the Master Game Guides at Escapology HQ, we assign the following people:\n Game Install Manager (GIM) - Has overall responsibility for the build and needs to understand the \nentire document.\n Install Crew - To manage the install and testing of the game.\n Expert in Escape Room Technology, PLC Controls and DMX Lighting - To manage PLC, DMX and \n12V connections.\n Purchasing Manager - Responsible for purchasing any required inventory.\n Architect - To produce any required plan or submissions to local authorities.\n Game Masters - To check gameplay and test once build is complete.\nPlease note also that this Master Game Guide has been written at a point in time, so please check \nthe \u201cAmends\u201d section first as it is possible we have made improvements to the Game and rather than \ncreating a whole new document, we have placed these amends at the end of the document. Please \nalso be sure to check you are using the most up to date versions of all assets and files.\nFinally, and most importantly, the GIM should not even turn a page in this Master Game Guide until they \nhave reviewed the training modules in the Escapology University and ideally played the game at one of \nour corporate facilities. \nThis game guide and assisting documentation has been written alongside our game build in our \ncorporate stores.\nWe hope you find the Master Game Guide useful and wish you every success with this game.\nThe Escapology Game Design Team\n7 DEADLY SINS\n6\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV2\nGame Install and Opening Rules\nYou must build the game to the specifications detailed in this Master Game Guide and you must gain \napproval for any additions or changes you want to make.

Can you find the hidden crypt and save \nyour soul?\nShort tagline: Free yourself from a DEADLY CURSE \nBriefing Video Script\n31st October, Present Day.... \nIn the late 19th century, during an ill-fated Halloween service, the deranged minister of Crickley Church \ndecided to kill his entire congregation after their confessions had convinced his twisted mind that they \nhad, among themselves, committed the 7 Deadly Sins. In order to punish them for their sins, the evil \nminister passed around poisoned bread and wine. \nAs the congregation choked on their last breaths, the minister incited a curse on the children playing in \nthe rooms beneath the church, and then buried himself alive in the church\u2019s hidden crypt, determined to \nhaunt the church forevermore. Your Great Grandfather was one of those innocent children. You began to \nthink back on the mysterious deaths of family members and close friends ever since that fateful night.\nTrawling the many ancestry websites to gather your evidence leads to a terrifying conclusion. Every \nyear on Halloween someone related to a member of the congregation dies an unnatural death. As you \nstudy the pattern of these accidents and the people involved you discover that you are next - and time \nis running out...\nIn your panic, you contact the American Paranormal Society and they have told you that the only way to \nend the curse is to find the body of the evil minister and drive a sacred dagger through the remnants of \nhis heart. This will lift the curse, and the souls of the victims will finally be able to rest in peace.\nNot wishing to take on such a daunting task alone, you have convinced your bravest friends to race to \nCrickley with you, break into the abandoned Church and find the hidden crypt. You enter the churchyard \nat 11 pm and the iron gates immediately slam shut behind you, locking you inside. The minister seems \nto be playing one last trick on you. Can you complete your mission and escape the church before the \nclock strikes Midnight? Or will you fulfill the curse and your name be the next on a gravestone in your \nfamily\u2019s graveyard plot? \nFind the hidden crypt, find the dagger, and drive it through the heart of the evil minister. Then and only \nthen you will be saved and will destroy the curse forever. Be brave... Stay calm... Work together... But \nremember... Time is of the essence...\n7 DEADLY SINS\n11\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV2\nCountdown Video Script\n(end of game)\nA new day has begun which means your time has run out.

Overview\nEach room is named and themed as follows:\nRoom 1: Graveyard\nThe first room of the game appears as if players are outside at night. Three of the four walls should \nensure players think they are in a graveyard. To achieve this look we use wall graphics to show \nperspective into the distance through trees and gravestones. \nA third of the way up the two side walls and the wall with the entrance door, are Texture Plus rock panels \n(the same as those used on the well prop) to give the effect of the graveyard having walls. On the back \nof the entrance door (to the game room) is a graphic that looks like a gate into the graveyard. You could \nenhance the look of the room with fake trees and plants to give a 3D effect. \nThe south wall should be built as the entrance to the church with an aged wooden face. The door to \nroom 2 should be heavy old wood with old looking metal hinges and ironwork on it. \nThe walls of this room will have gravestones in them, set as part of the wall panels.\n \nRoom 2: The Cathedral\nThis room is to look like the inside of a church from the late 19th century. The walls are stained wood, the \nfloors a zig zag patterned wood effect. The floor should be lighter in color to look weathered.\nOn the east wall there will be a wall graphic with a red carpet and pews to give the room depth to make \nit look like an old church. Two wooden pews will be near the wall. There are 4 framed maps along the \nsouth and north walls, two on either side of the doors, each with a peg in the middle. \nThe west wall will be built out 6 inches to accommodate tech and the support structure for the dials. \nAbove the dials will be a framed TV, made to look like a stained glass window, with the 7 dials inset \nunderneath. In front of this wall will be a lectern as used by the ministers in the church.\nThe North wall will look like wooden shelving, contained in elaborate curved panels. The middle \nshelving unit will be a hidden door to enter Room 3. \nThe walls of this room will have gravestones in them, set as part of the wall panels\n7 DEADLY SINS\n18\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV2\nRoom 3: The Crypt\nThis room will have a dark floor. You could use flagstones if you\u2019d like but we have a grey vinyl floor. The \nwalls will be finished with stone paneling designed to make this room look more creepy and less used.\nThe lighting will be provided by wall sconces with flickering bulbs. There is a pentagram asset adhered \nto the middle of the floor. \nThe South wall (the entrance from room 2) only holds two wall sconces for lighting and a cipher wheel. \nThe west wall has a casket with the Minister\u2019s body inside. The east wall has a shelving unit that holds \nnumerous skulls and tech behind. The North wall has the exit door and exit box (if you are exiting from a \ndifferent door than you enter). If not then this should be mounted back in Room 1.\n7 DEADLY SINS\n19\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV2\nThe 3D views below aren\u2019t 100% representative of the final game room layout, but are intended to give \nyou an idea of the look and feel of the room.\nExample 3D Renderings\n7 DEADLY SINS\n20\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV2\nExample 3D Renderings\n7 DEADLY SINS\n21\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV2\nExample 3D Renderings\n7 DEADLY SINS\n22\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV2\nExample 3D Renderings\n7 DEADLY SINS\n23\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV2\nExample 3D Renderings\n7 DEADLY SINS\n24\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV2\nGame Room Photos\nRoom 1\n7 DEADLY SINS\n25\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV2\nGame Room Photos\nRoom 2\n7 DEADLY SINS\n26\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV2\nRoom 3\nGame Room Photos\nRoom 3\nAMENDS\nGAMEPLAY\nPLANOGRAM\nINVENTORY\nPUZZLES\nDESIGN\nTHE GAME\nINTRODUCTION\nPUZZLES\n7 DEADLY SINS\n28\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV2\nPuzzles overview\nPICTURE\nNO NAME\n1\nWell\n2\nBirdhouse \n3\nGroundskeeper\u2019s \nRiddle\n4\nSpare Handles \n5\nStar Signs\nPICTURE\nNO NAME\n6\nNecklaces\n7\n7 Deadly Sins \n8\nPentagram\n9\nSkull Placement\n10\nHeart of the Minister\n11\nAmulet Ending\nAddendum Note:\nThis game guide and inventory has been written alongside our game build in our Town Square Las \nVegas venue. \n7 Deadly Sins is a game with many decorative pieces. Subsequently if you find any pieces of your \npurchased inventory that have not been used as part of a puzzle then they should be used to decorate \nthe room. Place them where you feel they would have the most impact using the game room.\n.\n7 DEADLY SINS\n29\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV2\nPUZZLE 1: Well\nLooking around the room, players will find a stick under the firewood bag on the grass next to the shed. \nThe bag will also have some pieces of the groundskeeper riddle in it. This stick has a ball/stopper on it\u2019s \nend. They will also see a well on the opposite side of the room. The light in the well will allow players to \nsee inside, as the rest of the room will appear to be 11pm and outdoors. \nAs players look inside the well they notice a second stick that does not have a ball/stopper on the end. \nThey will also see a key on a keyring. Now that players have both sticks, they can grab and pass the \nkey that was laying in the bottom of the well up and out through the top by moving the sticks from hole \nto hole. They can do this by placing the first stick with the ball/stopper into the hole at the bottom of the \nwell, players can fish out the second stick. \nDirecting their attention at the shed, players will notice the doors are closed and secured with a padlock. \nUsing the key obtained from the well, the shed can now be opened. \nAssets:\n Well and Sticks - (DIY7DS002)\n Firewood Bag - (DIY7DS020)\n 3\u201d Antique Style Lock- Iron with Brass - Padlock and Keys - (180263)\nConstruction:\n1.

The key is recessed into \nthis bottom piece. The key gained from sliding the bottom compartment out will be used to open the \nbirdhouse door, giving players a skull with an RFID mounted in the bottom. The clue for players to try to \npull the bottom out will be a \u201chandprint\u201d on the front of the birdhouse.\nOn the top of the piece that players slide out of the birdhouse is an inscription, \u201cIf I were a bird, what else \nwould there be?\u201d This will be used in Puzzle 7. \nThere will be 5 pieces from the Gravekeepers Riddle found in the birdhouse. One of the pieces will \nhave text on the back that is a clue, \u201cWhen you get the numbers, count the letters\u201d. This will be helpful to \nplayers in the next puzzle. This should be written or engraved into the wood.\nAssets:\n DIY7DS003 Birdhouse\n Westway Global Disc Tumbler Cam Lock with 7/8\u201d Cylinder and Chrome Finish, Keyed Alike - \n(180474)\n DIY7DS016 RFID Skulls\n DIY7DS006 Groundskeeper Riddle\nConstruction:\n1.

The handles are locked in and cannot be moved. Players should notice that they are all set at the \nsame height. There is a hinged shelf sitting just on top of the handles, locked shut with a 4 letter lock \nand a latch and hasp. The shelf can only hinge up once the lock has been removed. This is the only way \nplayers can remove the tools.\nIn order to remove the lock, players will have to decode a riddle. There is an incomplete puzzle \nmounted opposite the shed. There are words and letters that can be seen, and open spaces. Hidden \naround the room are the rest of the pieces needed to complete the riddle. Once all the wooden pieces \nhave been inserted correctly, using trial and error, the full riddle can be seen.  \nThe empty piece found in the birdhouse with the text on the back \u201cWhen you get the numbers count the \nletters\u201d will help players figure out the second part of the riddle. \n\u2022\t\nTidy\tthosE\tbugs\tN\tleevs\toff\tfloor\n\u2022\t\nmeasure\tbody\tso\tit\tFIts\tin\tgraVE\n\u2022\t\npick\tthE\trIte\ttool\tto\tdiG\tHole\ttoniTe\n\u2022\t\nbury\tem\tbeFOr\tsUmone\tcomes\tlookin\tfoR\tyou\nEach bullet point will indicate that it is a new sentence. The capital letters in each line spell out a number. \nStarting from the first letter, players will count the number that they\u2019ve spelled out, and the letter they \nland on will be the combination. For instance, the capital letters in line one spell out TEN (10). Players \nwill count 10 letters in and land on \u201cb\u201d. Continuing on with the rest of the lines will give players the \ncombination \u201cBURY\u201d. Now that players have this code they are able to unlock the handles of the tools.\nAssets:\n DIY7DS004 Shed \n DIY7DS005 Spare Handles and Bin\n DIY7DS006 Groundskeeper Riddle on the wall\n Master Lock 1535Dwd Vertical Resettable Word Combo Lock - (18068)\nConstruction\n1.

(Bin will read \u201cSpare Handles\u201d) In the bin there will be six holes in which players must correctly \nplace the differently sized handles in to get them to settle at the same height. If the handles are not the \nsame height when placed in, they are in the wrong order. \nWhen the handles are placed correctly, the lines burned into them will give a 6 digit numerical code \n(462817), this is gained from where the burned lines on the handles line up with the numbers on the front \nof the bin. This code will be used on the keypad by the entrance door to room 2 to gain access to the \nchurch.\nAssets\n DIY7DS005 Spare Handles Bin and Handles\n Seco-Larm SK-1011-SDQ Enforcer Access Control Keypad, Indoor digit keypad - (180125)\n Seco-Larm E-941SA-600 Enforcer Electromagnetic Lock with 600 Pound Holding Force - (180168)\nConstruction\n1.

There are spots missing from the skull wall, however these four \nskulls only work in four specific spots. Some skulls are held in behind chicken wire.\nTo figure out where to place the skulls, players must take the foldable ruler they have found in the chest \nin room 3 and measure the marked heights on the shed in the first room. The shed will have a mark \nand a name next to the mark. The skulls will also have the height in inches on the front of them allowing \nplayers to properly correspond the skulls to the correct heights which will get them the name of a \nperson.\nOnce players know which skull belongs to which person, they will need to take a look at the Minister\u2019s \npodium and read through the Death Record Document. This document outlines the names, death dates, \nand death certificate number. Looking at the top right of the document players will see a downward \narrow above the first name column and an arrow pointing right above the surname column.\nTo help players correlate the book with the skull wall, they will reference the white painted arrows in the \ntop left corner of the skull wall that points down and across, giving them a starting point. \nThis should lead players to place the skulls correctly. For instance, for Gia Thomas players should count \nthree spots down on the skull wall unit (relating to her first name having 3 letters). With her last name \nhaving 6 letters, players should count 6 spots over to the right on the skull wall before placing her skull. \nWhen all skulls are placed correctly the top of the Minister\u2019s casket will creak open and the dagger will \ndrop from pipework in the room, scaring the players. \nNames used for skull placement will be\n\u2022\t\nGia\tThomas\t(3,\t6)\n\u2022\t\nJohn\tMcCrane\t(4,\t7)\n\u2022\t\nJerry\tJenkins\t(5,\t7)\n\u2022\t\nRebekah\tDunn\t(7,\t4)\n7 DEADLY SINS\n39\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV2\nAssets:\n Wiha 61620 Outside Reading 6-Inch Depth Extension Long Life MaxiFlex Folding Ruler, 6-Foot - \n(180542)\n DIY7DS010 Minister\u2019s Podium\n DIY7DS014 Death Record Book Case\n DIY7DS015 Skull Wall\n DIY7DS016 RFID Skulls\nConstruction:\n1.

This is done \nby pieces of wood being stacked up at differing levels, and the tools screwed into the back of the shed. \nThe handles of the tools are all cut so that when they are inserted into the tool heads, they display at the \nsame height. The details of the tools used and the heights to cut them to are listed below. \nIn the spare handles bin, there are PVC guides so that the handles can be inserted and stand up straight \ninstead of falling over in the box. They need to stand up straight in order for one handle to only be seen \nthrough one of the holes on the front of the bin. The front part of the bin, including the holes is a single \nCNC piece. CNC files are available from Escapology on request. Note that this item will come unfinished \nand will need to be stained.\nOn each handle there will be a line burnt or etched all the way around. This line will locate at a specific \nnumber shown on the front of the bin. Each handle will need to be placed into the bin. For the puzzle to \nbe completed correctly, the handles will all have to be level.\nTo make this effect possible there is a screw in each PVC guide. If there were no screws, the handles \nwould all stop at the floor and be different heights. This would make the numbers you see when looking \nat the front of the bin inaccurate. When placed in the correct spots the code is 462817. \nSolving this puzzle will allow players to open the door to Room 2. This door is held closed by a 600lb \nmaglock and keypad (combined with an exit button). As the door to Room 2 will be custom made the \nfitting of the maglock should be included in this build.\nBuild description from our construction team\nThe post holes have a 1-1/2\u201d piece of PVC roughly 4\u201d long mounted into the head for the handle to slide \ninto. There is a screw to stop the handle at the correct depth so they look the same height. The back of \nthe post hole is made of 1/2\u201d ply in the back, with 1x2 cut to create the channels for the handles to slide \nbetween and a smaller section for it to stop the handle.\nAssets:\n Stain (not coded, your choice)\n PVC for guides (not coded, your choice)\n Screws to stop handles (not coded, your choice)\n Wooden Asset Front Piece of Bin - (406028)\n 16-Tine Welded Bow Rake - (20204)\n HDX Post Hole Digger - (20205)\n Ames Garden Hoe W/Serrated Blade - (20206)\n Wood Handle Transfer Shovel - (20207)\n7 DEADLY SINS\n54\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV2\nConstruction Reference Images\n    \n    \n7 DEADLY SINS\n55\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV2\nDIY7DS006 Groundskeeper Riddle \nThis prop is a CNC cut puzzle.

The pegs \nwill be used to rotate the necklace straps around meaning that the end of the necklace falls at a specific \npoint. You\u2019ll need to work this out by making the straps for the necklaces the correct length once you\u2019ve \nmade your frames.\nIf its a store purchased frame\n1.  You must remove the glass and replace it with a polycarbonate sheet (plexiglass .09\u201d) cut to fit. (Can \nbe done with a table saw and finishing blade!)\n2.  Check the back panel. If its cardboard replace it with the thickest allowable ply without protruding \nfrom the back portion. (most frames will only allow 1/4\u201d from a store.)\n3.  If it is only 1/4\u201d you will need to add a second layer cut to be flush with the outside of your frame \ndimensions so that it appears as part of the frame.\n4.  You must drill a hole through the plexiglass and 1 layer of the 1/4\u201d ply. We have had the best luck \ndrilling the plexiglass using a stepper bit. However on larger holes you can use a stepper then \ntransfer to a router to enlarge it. Be sure it\u2019s secured as it can shatter when using a router. On the 1/4\u201d \nply we recommend using a forstner bit. Any size will do to drill all the way through. but if using 1/2\u201d \nply a forstner can go half way and still leave a flat surface for the dowel.\n5.  Assemble your frame, image and first 1/4\u201d ply. Cut your image out where the hole is. Insert wood glue \nand set your peg till its flush in the back or fully seated in the hole. \n6.  Add the second layer of ply using 23 ga nails and glue.\n7.  Add a pre drilled wood screw to the back to ensure it stays in place.\nIf building your own frame\nThe same steps apply, just take into consideration allowing a thick enough trim to use a 1/2\u201d ply so that \nyou can drill half way through and still get a good seat / glue joint and not have the raw edges of ply \nsticking out from the back.\nAdvanced carpenters can either laminate the edges (edge banding) or use a piece of clear to frame it in \nto match.\nAssets:\n 0.5\u201d Dowel for pegs (not coded, your choice)\n Map of China - (P7DS007A)\n Map of Nepal - (P7DS007B)\n Map of Caribbean Islands - (P7DS007C)\n Map of Israel - (P7DS007D)\n Religious Symbols Note - (P7DS014)\n 4x Frames for Maps 30\u201d x 25\u201d - (180454)\n7 DEADLY SINS\n61\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV2\nConstruction Reference Images \n   \n \nDIY7DS012 Globe and Necklaces\nOnce you have completed DIY7DS011 you will be able to set the straps for the necklaces to the desired \nlength.

Once the dagger is in place and hits the limit switch, the mag lock at the side of \nthe casket will release, allowing players access to the amulet. Once opened fog will appear and a red \nLED will illuminate.\nThe casket will need to sit on a plinth to raise it to a comfortable height so players can reach it. The fog \nmachine should be installed under the casket in the base of the unit. The fog should exit through a vent.\nTo construct the limit switch setup you should cut open the ministers chest and set the limit switch as \nfollows. \nWe used a 2\u201d x 4\u201d piece of wood inside the chest cavity attaching through the upper left and right \nabdomen with 1-5/8\u201d lathe screws.

CNC files are available from Escapology on \nrequest. The amulet will have a location sensor connected to the exit system. This will turn the lock color \nfrom red to green showing that they can leave the room successfully.\nOnce the amulet is placed into the slot, the amulet box will trigger the exit box to change status from red \nto green and stop the clock. The amulet box should be mounted to the wall and wired PLC system for \nthis to occur. \nThe location sensor (RFID) should be fixed into the back of the sensor and filled so it is not obvious.

It is a five or six digit code to identify every item. Most items will also have a second code \nfrom the original supplier (Amazon, Ikea, etc etc) and we have tried to include as much detail as possible. \nWhen speaking to anyone from Escapology always refer to the SKU as we can identify items quickest \nusing this code.\nPlease note that many items are sourced locally through thrift shops, local websites (Craigslist for \nexample) and many items have been donated from members of staff or stock from our sister companies \nOsbourne Purdie and Shop247.com. Where this is the case we still provide a photograph and a \ndescription but these items may require a little extra effort to source. Where possible we\u2019ve tried to buy \nas many things as we can from repeatable sources (Amazon for example) but it has not always been \npossible to achieve the best results.\nIn addition to the items listed within this Inventory, you will also need an appropriate selection of tools as \nwell as items such as glue, velcro, sharpie marker pens, ultraviolet paint/pens, a printer, a laminator etc, \nas well as a comprehensive supply of hooks and other DIY items which will be useful to fix and attach \nitems around the room.\nThe prices we have listed are also just a rough guide taken at a point in time and many of the items will \nhave likely have a different price when you buy them. Also the DIY items are a rough guess based on \nwhat we at Escapology HQ have paid or what we might expect to pay. Nevertheless trust the Inventory \nand cost estimates are useful if helping plan and build your Game. Again use the Inventory as a \u2018guide\u2019 \n- as long as you achieve the same look and feel and as long as the puzzles remain consistent you can \nuse your local creative interpretation within reason and feel free to call us for advice and guidance.\nThe Escapology Game Design Team\nInventory Key:\nCOLOUR\nDESCRIPTION\nFurniture\nDecor\nPuzzle Props \nLocks\nDIY\nBuild Items\nCOLOUR\nDESCRIPTION\nTech\nMiscellaneous\nPrint\nGame Videos\nBrand & Marketing\n7 DEADLY SINS\n75\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV2\nSKU\nPICTURE\nSOURCE\nITEM\nPRICE\nQTY TOTAL\n180445\nAmazon\nPirate Treasure Chest With Iron Lock \nSkeleton Key 14 x 9 x 8 Decorative \nBox By Well Pack Box\n$89.99\n1\n$89.99\n \nFurniture\n7 DEADLY SINS\n76\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2023 - strictly confidential\nV2\nSKU\nPICTURE\nSOURCE\nITEM\nPRICE\nQTY TOTAL\n20248\nHome Depot\nShadow Hickory 7.1 in. x 47.6 in.

Or become the next \nvictim in this spine chilling horror story. Time is of the essence! \nBriefing Video Script\n\u201cCenturies ago, Mulberry Manor was built as a gift from Edward Mulberry to his wife and children. But \nbehind the beautiful facade lies a gruesome and bone chilling past.\nIn October of 1871, Edward and his children were killed in a cold-blooded massacre; their bodies torn to \npieces and scattered throughout the manor. Authorities mysteriously abandoned the case, leaving Lady \nMulberry alone, driven by grief to unravel the truth. Her far-fetched retellings of an evil that plagued her \nfamily were dismissed as delusions, until her sudden death one year later marking the tragic conclusion \nto the family fable.\nEvery year, on the anniversary of their deaths, torturous screams echo from within as if to lure people \ninside. Yet those who dared to enter suffered the same short lived fate. You are the only living \ndescendants to the Mulberry family, recently granted the estate. You have read the stories; you have \nheard the rumors; yet you enter with the wish to amass your fortune, hoping the rumors are just that. \nStanding in the very place each victim drew their final breaths, an ominous presence overwhelms you! \nDesperate to escape, you search for a way out but your fate has been sealed; you are trapped; and the \nhorror stories have turned into a nightmarish reality.\nLegend has it that the spirits feed on their victims\u2019 souls, harnessing the strength of a mystical talisman \nbelieved to bridge the living and the dead. Time becomes your opponent as your energy drains minute \nby minute. In one hour, the talisman will be corrupted beyond reversal, sentencing you to an eternity of \ntorture!\nDo you have what it takes to find the talisman and escape the clutches of evil? Or become the next \nvictim in this spine chilling horror story. Time is of the essence!\u201d\nPUZZLES\nHAUNTED HOUSE\n9\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2025 - strictly confidential\nV1\nPuzzles Overview\nNO\nNAME\n1\nSkeleton Keys\n2\nCause of Death\n3\nFamily Secrets\n4\nHuman Chain\n5\nHidden Hands\n6\nPentagram\n7\nOuija Board\n8\nDoll House\n9\nDestroy the Talisman\nHAUNTED HOUSE\n10\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2025 - strictly confidential\nV1\nPUZZLE 1: SKELETON KEYS \nStep 1: As the game starts the magic mirror will show the instruction: \u201cSearch the room for three keys. \nLook in here, over there and behind you. You need all three keys before they can help you.\u201d. At first \nglance these appear as simple instructions, but they each hide a deeper meaning hinting at three very \nspecific locations in the room where unique skeleton keys can be found.\nStep 2: Finding phrases such as \u201chere lies the truth\u201d and \u201cthere you are\u201d printed on objects around the \nroom, you will find the first two keys. For \u201cbehind you\u201d, find the final skeleton key hooked behind the \nframe of the magic mirror. You can now take your three keys to the bookcase where hiding in one of the \ncubes is a panel with a variety of keyholes scattered along it. \nStep 3: Only three of the keyholes are functioning. Place each key in its correct keyhole, turning it \nto activate it, where a green light will indicate the success of your action. Once all three keys are \nrecognised, in any order, this will trigger four books to jump out from the bookcase, protruding just \nenough to mark their significance. Spotlights above the moving book cubes will also turn on at this time. \nEvent:  Activate the moving books. \nHAUNTED HOUSE\n11\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2025 - strictly confidential\nV1\nPUZZLE 2: CAUSE OF DEATH \nStep 1: On a shelf in the Studio are four urns, labeled with the names of the four significant family \nmembers. Underneath each urn is a place for a cause of death plaque to sit, each one hinting at the \ncauses of death for each family member. For example: \u201cCaught up in their final wave, it was air they \nhad to crave. With hope held tight in their grip, a final breath escaped their lips.\u201d. This particular rhyme \nsuggests that the cause of death was drowning. Now the task is figuring out which family member \ndrowned using another clue. \nStep 2: To do this you need the books from the bookcase, pushed forward from the previous puzzle. \nThe four books each have a title, such as \u201cDrowned in Secrets\u201d. Surrounding the text is a pattern that \ncan also be found underneath a particular urn on the urn shelf. Each book title reveals a cause of death, \nwhich using the patterned border, allows you to match a plaque to the correct name-labeled urn.\nStep 3: By following this method you should end up with the four correct cause of death plaques, \npositioned underneath each of the urns, ignoring any spare cause of death plaques you are provided \nthat are not included in the puzzle. This action will cause two family portraits to tilt, one after the other, \nused purely for theatrical effect. This is shortly followed by the family whisper audios being activated, \nready to begin the next puzzle. \nCode & Connections: \n Edward\u2019s Urn: \u201cWith the secrets that you keep, the truth can start to cut you deep. As you see the \nblood splatter, the world around you starts to shatter.\u201d\n Theodore\u2019s Urn: \u201cA life lived at such a pace, can lead to one\u2019s quick fall from grace. As they took their \nfinal sips, the signs of life began to slip.\u201d\n Isabella\u2019s Urn: \u201cCaught up in their final wave, it was air they had to crave. With hope held tight in their \ngrip, a final breath escaped their lips.\u201d\n Agatha\u2019s Urn: \u201cIn an instant their fate was sealed, quickly lifted off their heels. A tragic end with just a \nrope, whilst others watched as they choked\u201d \nEvent:  Activate the family whispers. \nHAUNTED HOUSE\n12\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2025 - strictly confidential\nV1\nPUZZLE 3: FAMILY SECRETS \nStep 1: The family whispers will play from behind the family portraits. These are portraits of the four \nsignificant family members in the story, who are now revealing secrets that you must listen to by holding \nyour ear up to their portraits. Each family secret hides a secret direction and a number, for example: \u201cI \nfaced so much tragedy during my time here. In the end, all that was LEFT of me was heartbreak. I for \nONE, saw death as an escape.\u201d\nStep 2: Each whisper gives you both a direction, (such as Up, Down, Left or Right), as well as an order \nof those directions (such as First, Second, Third or Fourth). In the Studio on the front of the safe are four \nbrass dials that can rotate 360\u2019. The directions revealed in the family secrets are to be entered onto the \nfour brass dials in the order revealed as you listen to each one. \nStep 3: Turning the dials to face their correct directions using a small arrow on each one, will activate a \nloud knock to play from inside the large dresser. Once the knocking plays through, the front doors of the \ntall dresser will open up.  With access to the inside of the tall dresser, you can start the next puzzle. \nCode & Connections: \n Agatha: LEFT\n Theodore: UP\n Alfred: RIGHT\n Isabella: DOWN\nEvent:  Unlock the front doors of the tall dresser. \nHAUNTED HOUSE\n13\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2025 - strictly confidential\nV1\nPUZZLE 4: HUMAN CHAIN \nStep 1: Written on the inside of the dresser is the phrase: \u201cOnly one person must enter, closing the door \nbehind them. Break the rules and suffer the consequences.\u201d. You must volunteer one person to enter \nthe dresser and close the door, triggering a blacklight to shine on the inside revealing a new message: \n\u201cEvery lock requires the right key. The answer is within your reach.\u201d. The instruction will suggest that \nplayers must form a human circuit to connect a lock and key. \nStep 2: Inside the dresser is a copper plate with a picture of a padlock on it; this is one end of the human \ncircuit. Positioned further away in the Studio is a second copper plate with a picture of a key on it; this is \nthe other end of the human circuit. To connect the two, there is a small hole cut into the side face of the \ndresser. This allows the player in the dresser to reach and hold the hand of a player inside The Studio. \nStep 3: Place one hand on the picture of the key found in the Studio. Then hold hands with the player \nin the dresser by reaching through the hole. The isolated player in the dresser must then place their \nsecond hand over the padlock, connecting the human circuit. This action will release a false door in the \nback of the dresser to hinge open, leading you into the second room, the Secret Passageway. \nEvent:  Unlock the Secret Passageway. Enter Room 2. \nHAUNTED HOUSE\n14\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2025 - strictly confidential\nV1\nPUZZLE 5: HIDDEN HANDS \nStep 1: The walls of the Secret Passageway are covered in holes big enough to reach your hands into. \nAs you reach down each hole you will feel hands with palms facing up, with a symbol embossed into \ntheir palms. The symbols on the palms can be matched to a journal, where a list of symbols and their \nmeanings can be found. The purpose of the hands is to identify the three important symbols in the \njournal, so that you can discount the rest. \nStep 2: With each symbol is a written meaning, but some of the letters are missing from those \ndescriptions. If you combine the missing letters per description, they spell out numbers. Across the three \nsignificant symbols and their descriptions, you will get three numbers, one of which is a double digit \nnumber, therefore creating a four digit code. \nStep 3: As you explore the walls of the Secret Passageway you will notice a fourth hole. This does \nnot contain a hand but instead a padlock to enter in your code. The padlock allows you to remove \nan internal mechanism that keeps a crawlway to the Basement locked. Remove the lock to allow the \ncrawlway to swing open, giving you access into room 3, the Basement. \nCode & Connections: \n Symbol 1 spells the number ten.\n Symbol 2 spells the number three.\n Symbol 3 spells the number five\n The code is: 1035\n \nEvent:  Unlock the Basement. Enter Room 3. \nHAUNTED HOUSE\n15\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2025 - strictly confidential\nV1\nPUZZLE 6: PENTAGRAM \nStep 1: Found immediately as you enter the Basement is a light switch that when switched on, turns on \nthe room 3 lights and activates the pentagram projection on the floor of room 1. The pentagram is a star \nwithin a circle, with different symbols drawn on each point of the star. The aim is to figure out the order of \nsymbols. Painted around the wall of the Basement are the instructions, ordering the lines of the star and \ntherefore the symbols that come with it. \nStep 2: Now with an order of symbols, you need somewhere to \u2018enter it\u2019 in, like a code. Found in the \nBasement is the pentagram chest containing 5 spinning dials on its top face, all faces of the dials \nsurrounded by symbols. The dials act as the \u2018lock\u2019 to enter in the symbol sequence. You must align them \nin a horizontal row along the top to complete this action.\nStep 3: Aligning the five symbols in the correct order along the top of the pentagram chest will drop a \nsmall key out of the side.

This is located inside the \ndollhouse crate, unlocked. The Ouija Board contains all the letters of the alphabet. To interact with the \nOuija Board, you need the Magic Planchette.\nStep 2: As you drag the planchette over the Ouija Board, notice that some letters make the planchette \nglow as you pass over them. These are the significant letters that make up your code word. Because \nthe letters will be found in any order, you must reshuffle the letters to form a recognisable word that will \nbecome your code word. \nStep 3: The letters you receive are: H/E/L/P. Use the word \u201cHELP\u201d to unlock the four letter padlock \nlocking the small trap door shut inside the dollhouse crate. Inside there you will find a key that can be \nused to open the Mulberry Chest, located in room 1. \nCodes & Connections: \n HELP\nEvent:  Unlock the Mulberry Chest to find the remaining doll house items. \nHAUNTED HOUSE\n17\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2025 - strictly confidential\nV1\nPUZZLE 8: DOLL HOUSE \nStep 1: As you enter the Basement you will find a dollhouse mimicking the layout of the Manor, like a \n3D map of all three rooms. As you look closely into the doll house you will notice a variety of items \nacross the three rooms, positioned in specific locations, and highlighted in such a way to indicate their \nsignificance. \nStep 2: All the highlighted items can be found around the actual game room, with the aim to return them \nto their correct locations, according to where they are placed in the dollhouse. You can begin this puzzle \nas soon as you enter the Basement as some items will be readily available. The last few are found inside \nthe Mulberry Chest stopping you from completing this puzzle prematurely. As each item is returned to its \ntrue location, that particular object will light up inside the dollhouse indicating your success. \nStep 3: Once all dollhouse items are put in their correct locations, in any order, a final light will glow \ninside the dollhouse, illuminating the Talisman nook. This same nook will glow in the actual game room, \npointing you in this direction. Inside this compartment is the talisman. With the talisman in reach, you can \nnow complete the final puzzle and carry out the talisman ritual.\nEvent:  Unlock the talisman compartment and find the talisman. \nHAUNTED HOUSE\n18\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2025 - strictly confidential\nV1\nPUZZLE 9: DESTROY THE TALISMAN \nStep 1: To complete the talisman ritual you will need the talisman itself, the ritual scroll, a blacklight, a \nset of candles that are found unlocked throughout the game room, and the talisman podium located in \nroom 1 where all these items belong. Start by placing the ritual scroll over the podium, which is a perfect \nfit, secured with magnets in the corners. The blacklight will show rings over the scroll, indicating the \nposition for all the candles to be placed. \nStep 2: Next you must get the talisman, placing it in the centre of the podium, in a same-sized \nindentation. But each side of the talisman has a different ritual message; one good side that explains \nthe breaking of the bridge (your objective) and one bad side that explains the sealing of the bridge. You \nmust place the talisman face up to see the message that aligns with your objective in order for this to \nwork. \nStep 3: Completing the ritual will activate the \u2018talisman sequence\u2019. This is accompanied by visual, audio \nand lighting effects but ultimately results in the talisman \u2018disappearing\u2019 in front of your eyes. At the end of \nthe sequence the podium will appear empty, with no talisman in sight, right before the shattered pieces \nof the talisman are projected into the room at your feet portraying the destruction of the talisman and the \nsuccessful completion of the games\u2019 objective. \nEvent:  Destroy the talisman, stop the timer and escape! \nAMENDS\nHAUNTED HOUSE\n20\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2025 - strictly confidential\nV1\nAmends\nFOR FURTHER DETAILS, PLEASE CONTACT \nEscapology LLC\n11951 International Drive\nOrlando\nFL32821 USA\nE: support@escapology.com\nCONFIDENTIALITY\nThis Master Game Guide and associated files, \nin either printed or electronic format are the \nproperty of Escapology LLC.

Find the hidden treasure and break the deadly sunset curse, before you become the \nnext prisoner to The Soul Catcher!\u201d \nBriefing video script\n\u201cMany years ago, there was a crew of barbaric pirates led by their bold and intrepid Captain. His \nname was Captain Goldbeard and he spent his years voyaging the seas in the hopes of acquiring \ntreasures beyond his wildest dreams. But one night, many moons ago, the Captain and his crew landed \nthemselves in troubled water embarking on a quest where few others dare go, aboard an abandoned \nship laden with treasure, known as \u2018The Soul Catcher\u2019.\nBut little did he know what lay ahead\u2026 As the old pirates tale suggests, the treasures aboard The Soul \nCatcher were protected by a deadly sunset curse. As the story goes, there is only one rightful owner of \nthe fortune and those who don\u2019t succeed nor belong are to have their souls captured by the ship come \nsunset, holding them prisoner inside The Soul Catcher for eternity! And this was the poor fate for the \nCaptain and his crew, who fell victim to the deadly curse and until today, not a soul has dared come near. \nBut that means only one thing\u2026 The treasures are still up for grabs!\nNow if you\u2019re here today for that very reason, to find the fortune, I must warn you of the voyage you are \nabout to take. But the deadly sunset curse waits for no one and you only have one hour before the sun \nsets beyond the horizon where you will be left prisoner aboard The Soul Catcher for eternity, with no \nescape! Do you have what it takes to find the hidden treasure and beat the deadly sunset curse? Are \nyou the rightful owners of the fortune or will you become the next prisoner to The Soul Catcher? \nTread carefully and don\u2019t let this adventure be your last!

Defer to the compartment contents \nchecklist for individual item locations\nPuzzle 1: Pirates Talk\nStep 1: Wooden pirates talk frame built onto the walls of the Cargo Deck. The frame is built up of six \nsections, each section with an incomplete pirate phrase etched into the planks on the left. For example, \none plank might read \u2018Bottle Of\u2019 but the rest of the phrase is missing.\nStep 2: Found unlocked in the Cargo Deck, you will find loose plank pieces. Each plank has a word \netched on it, being the other half to the incomplete pirate phrases.\nStep 3: Use the slots on the right hand side of the wooden wall mounted frame to insert the plank pieces \nand complete the popular pirate phrases. For example, the plank with the word \u2018Rum\u2019 etched onto it \nmust slot in beside the \u2018Bottle of\u2019 wording on the frame to create the phrase, \u2018Bottle of Rum\u2019\nCodes & Connections: \n Jolly - Roger\n Ahoy - Matey\n Aye Aye - Captain\n Walk The - Plank\n Bottle Of - Rum\n Shiver Me - Timbers\nPuzzle Photos\nA PIRATE\u2019S CURSE\n12\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nV3\nPuzzle 2: Pieces Of Eight \nStep 1: Find 3 coin bags weighing noticeably different amounts, each labeled with a snake symbol \nthat appear slightly different from each other. These weights correspond with values, as written on a \ncalculation canvas, (e.g \u2018The heaviest coin bag contains the value of $85. The middleweight coin bag \nhas a value of $50. The lightest coin bag has a value of $15.\u2019). The calculation canvas/instruction places \nthe different snake prints into a calculation where their values are added and subtracted to create a new \nthree digit number.\nStep 2: By searching the Cargo Deck you will find 8 pieces of eight. Each one is number labeled from \n1 to 8. You only need three coins in order to complete this puzzle. These are the three labeled with the \nnumbers that make up the answer to the calculation from above; 1, 6 and 5. \nStep 3: The 3 significant pieces of eight coins should now be placed in the coin-shaped indentations \nin the top of the coin barrel to \u2018spell-out\u2019 the answer. For example, with the answer being 165 the coin \nlabeled 1 must be placed in the first indentation, with 6 in the middle slot and the coin labeled 5 in the \nlast one. This releases the gunpowder handle that can now be pushed down to activate the \u2018explosion\u2019.\nCodes & Connections: \nCoin Bag Values by Weight: \n Pink - Heaviest - $80\n Green - Middleweight - $50\n Blue - Lightest - $15\nActual Calculation\n 85 + 85 - 50 + 15 + 15 + 15 = 165\nPieces of Eight Slots\n Pieces of eight 1 = Slot A\n Pieces of eight 6 = Slot B \n Pieces of eight 5 = Slot C\nEvent:  \nUnlock the crate crawlway and access the Main Deck.  Also unlocs the skeleton\u2019s \nfloor compartment and activte the porthole lights\nVariations Between Game Modes: The method of completion for this puzzle does not vary between \ngame modes.

Upon first inspection, none of the symbols are going to appear significant. \nStep 2: Found unlocked in the cargo deck will be a pirate flag, the same size as the inside of the crates\u2019 \ndoor, that fits perfectly over the grid of symbols. When placed over the inside door of the crate, four of \nthe symbols will be left in your view revealing the four significant symbols needed in this puzzle. \nStep 3: The cargo deck door is made up of jail bars, four of which rotate 360\u2019 and are surrounded by \nsymbols. Using the flag overlay on the inside door of the crate, identify the four symbols that you need \nto align on the lower portion of the jail bars. You will discover that there is no specific order. Instead, each \nof the symbols will only be found on one of the four rotating bars so there is only one place to align each \nsymbol. Aligning all four correctly is the action that will unlock the door and give full access into the Main \nDeck.\nVariations Between Game Modes: The cargo deck door will open on completion of the Pieces of Eight \npuzzle so this puzzle is skipped for the simplified game mode.\nPuzzle Photos\nEvent:  \nUnlock the Cargo Deck door and unlock the skeletons floor compartment.\nA PIRATE\u2019S CURSE\n15\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nV3\nPuzzle 4: Spinning Sandboxes\nStep 1: Around the game room walls are four framed sandboxes that can rotate 360\u2019. In entering the \nroom, only one will be unlocked to begin with, the rest locked with four digit combination locks. Turning \nthe sandboxes 180\u2019 moves the sand inside, revealing phrases written behind them. Each phrase is a \nshort rhyme with the final word missing where you can use common sense to fill in the blanks. \nStep 2: The missing words at the end of each phrase becomes the code to unlock the next sandbox. \nHowever, the letters need to be translated into numbers which is done using the sand bottles. Find \nsand bottles around the room in unlocked locations. Inside each bottle is a printed letter with a number \nstamped on its cap; the purpose of the bottles is to translate each letter into a number. Spell out each \ncodeword with the sand bottles to turn each one into a four digit code. The answer from sandbox 1 \nunlocks sandbox 2; the answer from sandbox 2 unlocks sandbox 3 and so on. \nStep 3: When the fourth sandbox is unlocked, rotate it 180\u2019 just like the others. However unlike the others \nthe message inside will not reveal a code word but instead, act as a trigger to activate the next event \nwhen turned upside down. This action will unlock the second section of the 2-part skeletons chest. \nCodes & Connections: \nSandbox Poems & Code Words\n \u201cDeath is something you can\u2019t reverse, if you want to live you must break the ?????\u201d (CURSE) \n \n- Use the sand bottles to translate CURSE into 5316\n \u201cAn eternity at sea is what you face if you can\u2019t escape this deadly ?????\u201d (PLACE) \n \n- Use the sand bottles to translate PLACE into 2475\n \u201cMany souls have laid to rest in their search to find the hidden ?????\u201d (CHEST)\n \n- Use the sand bottles to translate CHEST into 5860\nEvent:  \nUnlock the lower section of the 2-part skeletons chest. \nA PIRATE\u2019S CURSE\n16\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nV3\nPuzzle Photos\nA PIRATE\u2019S CURSE\n17\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nV3\nPuzzle 5: Ships Wheel\nStep 1: Attached to the wall of the Main Deck is a ship\u2019s wheel on a rotating axis. The ship\u2019s wheel has \ntwo different colored handles, one white handle and one black handle. There is also a circle of letters \nbehind the wheel, revealed by a small hole in the outer wheel. As you align the handles to certain \npoints, one of the hidden letters on the circle of letters are revealed. The aim of the puzzle is to spin the \nwheel to point the colored handles in the directions revealed by portholes scattered around the walls of \nthe game room. \nStep 2: Attached to the game room walls are 6 number labeled portholes that each reveal a ship with \neither a black or white sail, pointing either North, South, East or West. This determines the direction in \nwhich each colored handle on the ship\u2019s wheel needs turning and in what order. For example, if the first \nship has a white sail and it is pointing East, then the white handle on the wheel must be turned to align \nwith that same direction.\nStep 3: With each turn of the wheel, the hole on the outer circle of the ship\u2019s wheel will line up with a \nletter on the wall behind it. With six portholes and six directions to point the handles on the wheel, you \nwill get a six letter code: \u2018SECRET\u2019. \nCodes & Connections: \n Sail 1 has players move the white handle to East\n Sail 2 has players move the black handle to West\n Sail 3 has players move the white handle to North\n Sail 4 has players move the white handle to North\n Sail 5 has players move the black handle to South\n Sail 6 has players turn the white handle to North\nEvent:  \nUnlock the gold cryptex lockbox.\nA PIRATE\u2019S CURSE\n18\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nV3\nPuzzle Photos\nA PIRATE\u2019S CURSE\n19\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nV3\nPuzzle 6: Captain\u2019s Door\nStep 1: The Captain\u2019s door separates the Main Cabin and the Captain\u2019s Quarters.

The large map will show various islands and seas, all name labeled, (E.g \nKraken Cave or Black Rock). The magnet tool must be used to follow a pathway on the map but this \npathway must first be discovered\nStep 2: Spread across the floors of all three rooms, are a set of footprints each one pointing towards the \nnext. As you stand on each footprint, a location lights up on the large map on the wall. The footprints that \nyou stand on will be facing a specific direction, directly towards another set of footprints indicating the \nnext ones on the sequence. As you follow the footprints around the room, locations will light up on the \nmap lighting up the correct path.\nStep 3: Use the magnet tool to follow the path on the map. Do this by placing the magnet tool on the \nimage of the ship\u2019s wheel beside each location, one by one until you complete the sequence. \nCodes & Connections: \nOrder of Pathway (1st to 6th)\n Castaway Cove\n Full Moon\n Smugglers Crossing\n Black Rock\n Reef of refuge\n Kraken Cave\nEvent:  \nUnlock captain\u2019s desk drawer (2 of 2). \nA PIRATE\u2019S CURSE\n22\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nV3\nPuzzle Photos\nA PIRATE\u2019S CURSE\n23\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nV3\nPuzzle 9: Loot Crates\nStep 1: Find 6 wooden crates around the game room. They each stack on top of one another like \na jigsaw, connected together using tetris shaped grooves on their tops and bases. Connect the six \ntogether so that they align in a vertical column. Each of the crates are covered in stamps some of which \nwill face towards whilst others face either to the left, right or on the back faces of the crates due to the \nway they are stacked. This means that nearly all the crates have more than one stamp on them. \nStep 2: The loot log inside the captain\u2019s journal can be used to associate a single digit value with each \nof the items represented on the crate stamps. The aim of the puzzle is to look at each individual face of \nthe crate stack and add up the item values on each side, creating the total value of each crate face. For \nexample, taking one face at a time, match the stamps to items in the loot log, and add up their quantities \nto create a new single digit number per face..\nStep 3: Follow this pattern to add up the total value of all four sides of the crate, ordering the numbers \nfrom face 1 to face 4. This leaves you with a new four digit code for the jewelry box.\nCodes & Connections: \n Left Face Total = 4\n Front Face Total = 7\n Right Face Total = 1\n Back Face Total = 3\nComplete Code: 4713\nEvent:  \nUnlock jewelry box, find the amulet\nA PIRATE\u2019S CURSE\n24\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nV3\nPuzzle Photos\nA PIRATE\u2019S CURSE\n25\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nV3\nPuzzle 10: The Curse Breaker\nStep 1: Inside the jewelry box will find a pendant necklace. This is to be returned to the portrait on the \nwall on the Captain\u2019s Quarters, labeled \u2018The Soul Catcher\u2019. The necklace must be returned to the chest \nof the portrait to activate the magic book animation.  Sitting on the captain\u2019s desk is an open book, but \nthe book is blank until the medallion is returned to the Soul Catcher portrait. The magic book animation \nused light underneath it to shine a message onto the pages which would otherwise not be seen. The \nmagic book reveals the curse breaker note which reads: \u201cFirst it is my trust you should gain. Second, you \nmust return my love to me. Third, you must rid me of my pain. This will break the curse and set you free.\u201d. \nAt the end of the magic book sequence, the treasure chest is revealed by rising out of the tall dresser. \nStep 2: There are three significant words in the curse breaker note; trust, love and pain. These words \nare all written on the spines of colored books in the tall dresser associating each significant word with a \ncolor: Trust is green; love is red; and pain is blue. As the treasure chest rises out of the tall dresser you \nwill notice that it contains a set of colored gems.\nStep 3: The curse breaker note from the magic book creates an order of words and colors, therefore \ncreating an order of the colored gems inside the treasure chest. Each colored gem needs to be \nreturned to the assembly plaque located in the first room beside the exit door. The assembly plaque \ncontains three slots, one for each gem, each slot lit up with a color. To complete the puzzle, place the \ngems in their corresponding colored slots using the order given from the curse breaker note.

Find the hidden treasure and break the deadly sunset curse, before you become the \nnext prisoner to The Soul Catcher!\u201d \nBriefing video script\n\u201cMany years ago, there was a crew of barbaric pirates led by their bold and intrepid Captain. His \nname was Captain Goldbeard and he spent his years voyaging the seas in the hopes of acquiring \ntreasures beyond his wildest dreams. But one night, many moons ago, the Captain and his crew landed \nthemselves in troubled water embarking on a quest where few others dare go, aboard an abandoned \nship laden with treasure, known as \u2018The Soul Catcher\u2019.\nBut little did he know what lay ahead\u2026 As the old pirates tale suggests, the treasures aboard The Soul \nCatcher were protected by a deadly sunset curse. As the story goes, there is only one rightful owner of \nthe fortune and those who don\u2019t succeed nor belong are to have their souls captured by the ship come \nsunset, holding them prisoner inside The Soul Catcher for eternity! And this was the poor fate for the \nCaptain and his crew, who fell victim to the deadly curse and until today, not a soul has dared come near. \nBut that means only one thing\u2026 The treasures are still up for grabs!\nNow if you\u2019re here today for that very reason, to find the fortune, I must warn you of the voyage you are \nabout to take. But the deadly sunset curse waits for no one and you only have one hour before the sun \nsets beyond the horizon where you will be left prisoner aboard The Soul Catcher for eternity, with no \nescape! Do you have what it takes to find the hidden treasure and beat the deadly sunset curse? Are \nyou the rightful owners of the fortune or will you become the next prisoner to The Soul Catcher? \nTread carefully and don\u2019t let this adventure be your last!

Defer to the compartment contents \nchecklist for individual item locations\nPuzzle 1: Pirates Talk\nStep 1: Wooden pirates talk frame built onto the walls of the Cargo Deck. The frame is built up of six \nsections, each section with an incomplete pirate phrase etched into the planks on the left. For example, \none plank might read \u2018Bottle Of\u2019 but the rest of the phrase is missing.\nStep 2: Found unlocked in the Cargo Deck, you will find loose plank pieces. Each plank has a word \netched on it, being the other half to the incomplete pirate phrases.\nStep 3: Use the slots on the right hand side of the wooden wall mounted frame to insert the plank pieces \nand complete the popular pirate phrases. For example, the plank with the word \u2018Rum\u2019 etched onto it \nmust slot in beside the \u2018Bottle of\u2019 wording on the frame to create the phrase, \u2018Bottle of Rum\u2019\nCodes & Connections: \n Jolly - Roger\n Ahoy - Matey\n Aye Aye - Captain\n Walk The - Plank\n Bottle Of - Rum\n Shiver Me - Timbers\nVariations Between Game Modes: This portion of the game guide details how each puzzle is changed \nto accommodate the simplified version of the game. The method of completion for this puzzle does not \nvary between game modes.

These weights correspond with values, as written on a \ncalculation canvas, (e.g \u2018The heaviest coin bag contains the value of $85. The middleweight coin bag \nhas a value of $50. The lightest coin bag has a value of $15.\u2019). The calculation canvas/instruction places \nthe different snake prints into a calculation where their values are added and subtracted to create a new \nthree digit number.\nStep 2: By searching the Cargo Deck you will find 8 pieces of eight. Each one is number labeled from \n1 to 8. You only need three coins in order to complete this puzzle. These are the three labeled with the \nnumbers that make up the answer to the calculation from above; 1, 6 and 5. \nStep 3: The 3 significant pieces of eight coins should now be placed in the coin-shaped indentations \nin the top of the coin barrel to \u2018spell-out\u2019 the answer. For example, with the answer being 165 the coin \nlabeled 1 must be placed in the first indentation, with 6 in the middle slot and the coin labeled 5 in the \nlast one. This releases the gunpowder handle that can now be pushed down to activate the \u2018explosion\u2019.\nCodes & Connections: \nCoin Bag Values by Weight: \n Pink - Heaviest - $80\n Green - Middleweight - $50\n Blue - Lightest - $15\nActual Calculation\n 85 + 85 - 50 + 15 + 15 + 15 = 165\nPieces of Eight Slots\n Pieces of eight 1 = Slot A\n Pieces of eight 6 = Slot B \n Pieces of eight 5 = Slot C\nEvent:  \nUnlock the crate crawlway and access the Main Deck.\nVariations Between Game Modes: The method of completion for this puzzle does not vary between \ngame modes.

Upon first inspection, none of the symbols are going to appear significant. \nStep 2: Found unlocked in the cargo deck will be a pirate flag, the same size as the inside of the crates\u2019 \ndoor, that fits perfectly over the grid of symbols. When placed over the inside door of the crate, four of \nthe symbols will be left in your view revealing the four significant symbols needed in this puzzle. \nStep 3: The cargo deck door is made up of jail bars, four of which rotate 360\u2019 and are surrounded by \nsymbols. Using the flag overlay on the inside door of the crate, identify the four symbols that you need \nto align on the lower portion of the jail bars. You will discover that there is no specific order. Instead, each \nof the symbols will only be found on one of the four rotating bars so there is only one place to align each \nsymbol. Aligning all four correctly is the action that will unlock the door and give full access into the Main \nDeck.\nCodes & Connections:\nn/a\nVariations Between Game Modes: The cargo deck door will open on completion of the Pieces of Eight \npuzzle so this puzzle is skipped for the simplified game mode.\nPuzzle Photos\nEvent:  \nUnlock the Cargo Deck door and unlock the skeletons floor compartment.\nA PIRATE\u2019S CURSE\n15\nV1\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nPuzzle 4: Spinning Sandboxes\nStep 1: Around the game room walls are four framed sandboxes that can rotate 360\u2019. In entering the \nroom, only one will be unlocked to begin with, the rest locked with four digit combination locks. Turning \nthe sandboxes 180\u2019 moves the sand inside, revealing phrases written behind them. Each phrase is a \nshort rhyme with the final word missing where you can use common sense to fill in the blanks. \nStep 2: The missing words at the end of each phrase becomes the code to unlock the next sandbox. \nHowever, the letters need to be translated into numbers which is done using the sand bottles. Find \nsand bottles around the room in unlocked locations. Inside each bottle is a printed letter with a number \nstamped on its cap; the purpose of the bottles is to translate each letter into a number. Spell out each \ncodeword with the sand bottles to turn each one into a four digit code. The answer from sandbox 1 \nunlocks sandbox 2; the answer from sandbox 2 unlocks sandbox 3 and so on. \nStep 3: When the fourth sandbox is unlocked, rotate it 180\u2019 just like the others. However unlike the others \nthe message inside will not reveal a code word but instead, act as a trigger to activate the next event \nwhen turned upside down. This action will unlock the second section of the 2-part skeletons chest. \nCodes & Connections: \nSandbox Poems & Code Words\n \u201cDeath is something you can\u2019t reverse, if you want to live you must break the ?????\u201d (CURSE) \n \n- Use the sand bottles to translate CURSE into 5316\n \u201cAn eternity at sea is what you face if you can\u2019t escape this deadly ?????\u201d (PLACE) \n \n- Use the sand bottles to translate PLACE into 2475\n \u201cMany souls have laid to rest in their search to find the hidden ?????\u201d (CHEST)\n \n- Use the sand bottles to translate CHEST into 5860\nVariations Between Game Modes: The method of completion for this puzzle does not vary between \ngame modes.

The ship\u2019s wheel has \ndifferent colored handles along with a circle of letters behind it revealed by a small cut out on the outer \nwheel. The aim of the puzzle is to spin the wheel to point the colored handles in the direction revealed \nby portholes scattered around the walls of the game room.\nStep 2: Attached to the game room walls are 6 number labeled portholes that each reveal a ship with \ncolored sails pointing either North, South, East or West. This determines the direction in which each \ncolored handle on the ship\u2019s wheel needs turning and in what order. For example, if the first ship has a \nblue sail and it is pointing East, then the blue handle on the wheel must be turned to align with that same \ndirection.\nStep 3: With each turn of the wheel, the hole on the outer circle of the ship\u2019s wheel will line up with a \nletter on the wall behind it. With six directions on the pathway you get a six digit code made up of 6 \nletters, (\u2018SECRET\u2019). \nCodes & Connections: \n Sail 1 has players move the yellow handle to East = S\n Sail 2 has players move the blue handle to West = E\n Sail 3 has players move the green handle to South = C\n Sail 4 has players move the yellow handle to West = R\n Sail 5 has players move the purple handle to North = E\n Sail 6 has players turn the white handle to West = T\nVariations Between Game Modes: For the simplified game mode, an instruction plaque above the ship\u2019s \nwheel is released before the start of the puzzle. This reveals the six significant directions and their \ncorresponding colors. This eliminates the use of the portholes but the method of spinning the wheel and \ngetting the code word remains the same.

The men in the portraits also have distinct \nfeatures, matching each one to one of the encased skull head props that therefore need to be placed \non each correct corresponding shelf. \nStep 3: To complete the puzzle, place the skulls on the correct shelves by matching each one to their \nlookalikes. There is no specific order of placement required.\nCodes & Connections: \nCaptain\u2019s Names & Significant Features:\n Captain J. Goldbeard = Big Red Beard\n Captain T.

This means that nearly all the crates have more than one stamp on them. \nStep 2: The loot log inside the captain\u2019s journal can be used to associate a quantity / single digit number \nwith each of the items represented on the crate stamps. The aim of the puzzle is to look at each \nindividual face of the crate stack and add up the item quantities to give a different single digit number. \nFor example, looking at the crates in their standing vertical stack you may notice stamps for rum and \ncigars down the back face whilst seeing different stamps on the left face and therefore different objects. \nTaking one face at a time, match the stamps to items in the loot log, and add up their quantities to create \na new single digit number per face.\nStep 3: Use the loot log to add up the total quantities of items showing on each side / face of the crate \nstack. The captain\u2019s journal will also tell you how to order the single digit numbers (e.g. Left Face digit \nfirst, Front, Right then Back). This leaves you with a new four digit code for the jewelry box.\nCodes & Connections: \n Left Face Total = 4\n Front Face Total = 7\n Right Face Total = 1\n Back Face Total = 3\nComplete Code: 4713\nVariations Between Game Modes: For the simplified game mode, the trunk contains a simplified version \nof the Captain\u2019s journal which makes adding up the quantities and ordering the face easier. However the \ncode retrieved will remain the same.  As this is a non-tech puzzle, there are no additional events for this \ngame mode after the completion of this puzzle\nEvent:  \nUnlock jewelry box.\nA PIRATE\u2019S CURSE\n24\nV1\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nPuzzle Photos\nA PIRATE\u2019S CURSE\n25\nV1\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nPuzzle 10: The Curse Breaker\nStep 1: Inside the jewelry box will find a pendant necklace. This is to be returned to the portrait on the \nwall on the Captain\u2019s Quarters, labeled \u2018The Soul Catcher\u2019. The necklace must be returned to the chest \nof the portrait to activate the magic book animation.  Sitting on the captain\u2019s desk is an open book, but \nthe book is blank until the medallion is returned to the Soul Catcher portrait. The magic book animation \nused light underneath it to shine a message onto the pages which would otherwise not be seen. The \nmagic book reveals the curse breaker note which reads: \u201cFirst it is my trust you should gain. Second, you \nmust return my love to me. Third, you must rid me of my pain. This will break the curse and set you free.\u201d. \nAt the end of the magic book sequence, the treasure chest is revealed by rising out of the tall dresser. \nStep 2: There are three significant words in the curse breaker note; trust, love and pain. These words \nare all written on the spines of colored books in the tall dresser associating each significant word with a \ncolor: Trust is green; love is red; and pain is blue. As the treasure chest rises out of the tall dresser you \nwill notice that it contains a set of colored gems.\nStep 3: The curse breaker note from the magic book creates an order of words and colors, therefore \ncreating an order of the colored gems inside the treasure chest. Each colored gem needs to be \nreturned to the assembly plaque located in the first room beside the exit door. The assembly plaque \ncontains three slots, one for each gem, each slot lit up with a color. To complete the puzzle, place the \ngems in their corresponding colored slots using the order given from the curse breaker note. Returning \nthe jewels to the assembly plaque in the correct slots and the correct order is the action that breaks the \ncurse and allows you to escape. \nCodes & Connections: \nCurse Breaker Key Words, Color Connections & Stone Assembly Order\n Keyword 1: Trust -> Green Stone -> Indentation 01\n Keyword 2: Love -> Red Stone -> Indentation 02\n Keyword 3: Pain -> Blue Stone -> Indentation 03\nVariations Between Game Modes: The method of completion for this puzzle does not vary between \ngame modes. Defer to the M3 story for additional events after completion of this puzzle in simplified \nmode.\nEvent:  \nUnlock exit door, stop the timer and escape.\nA PIRATE\u2019S CURSE\n26\nV1\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nPuzzle Photos\nINVENTORY\nA PIRATE\u2019S CURSE\n28\nV1\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nInventory\nFor this game all items required (including spares) will be delivered as part of your kit).

Welcome to the Gotham City Guardian training programme. You have been \ncarefully selected into the programme to attempt a new and intense training exercise designed to \nteach you how to solve problems, push your limits and catch criminals. You are currently standing in a \ncustom simulation of the Batcave filled with bat-tech tailored to your mission needs. I will be using the \ncommunication systems built into the Batcomputer to deliver guidance along the way but the rest is up \nto you and your mission begins right now. \nI have planted a training device in the heart of Gotham City, filled with a non-harmful chemical compound \ndesigned to mimic a legitimate chemical leak without the fatality. The device is fitted with a countdown \nclock that will release the gas exactly 60 minutes after your mission start time, but finding the device \nis up to you. You must start in the batcave before finding your way into the West wing of Blackgate \nPenitentiary, typically used to house high-risk inmates. However a prisoner transport truck has just \nmoved the inmates out of the facility giving you the perfect opportunity to encounter a very real and \ndangerous environment rigged with traps and clues. \nIf you can find the device and stop the release of the gas before the countdown timer ends, you will \nhave successfully completed your mission and cleared your training. But if you fail, you will leave and \nnot be invited to return into the programme again so this is your one and only chance to get this right. \nDo you have what it takes to complete your mission and earn your status? Can you locate the chemical \ndevice and defuse the situation before time runs out? You have just one hour to prove you have the \nability to fight for justice or will the criminal world just be out of your league?

The map is split into \nmultiple districts and is also displayed on a grid background. A similar grid can be found attached to one \nof the game room walls, but there is no map shown over it. Instead the plain, magnetic grid has route \nlines on it similarly to what is shown on the map but with far less detail. \nStep 2: The grid found on the wall will be magnetic and there will be a small magnet tool attached to it. \nSome of the grid squares on the plexi wall attachment will be magnetized whilst the others are not. The \nmagnetized grid squares will create a path of certain squares that can be transferred onto the map on \nthe interactive Batcomputer. \nStep 3: To replicate the pathway, touch the grid squares on the Map of Gotham on the Batcomputer. As \nyou replicate the pathway over the map on the screen, touch each of the grid squares in the correct \norder from start to finish following the exact path that you did on the magnetic grid.

Above \neach key hook is the name of a building and underneath, the shape of that building. Four of the keys in \nthe 16 grid are missing; these are the four significant building names and shapes you are bringing into \nthe next steps of the puzzle. The four shapes can be matched to the Blackgate Building Chart on the \nother side of the room, leading you to the second step of the puzzle. \nStep 2: The Blackgate Building Chart has 18 buildings of different shapes. Start by finding the four \nsignificant buildings from step 1 on the chart; these are the only four you need in the puzzle. There are \nfour \u2018stats\u2019 underneath each building on the chart, numbered from 1-4. Notice that inside the key box, the \nbuilding names are numbered from 1-4, telling which of the stats on the building chart are important to \nyou in the puzzle. \nStep 3: Examples of the written stats on the Blackgate Building Chart including, \u201cFloor Level: 2\u201d or, \n\u201cMaximum Capacity: 3\u201d. It is these numbers that come together to form your code.

This applies to \nboth game modes.\nBATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT CHALLENGE\n15\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nV2\nPUZZLE 5: Inmate Profiles\nStep 1: Inside the holding cell are 6 double ended chains with one side fixed to the wall but the other \nside needing to be connected to hooks on the opposite end. Each chain will only reach one hook \nperfectly because of their length so this is how that connection is made. All 6 left hand hooks are \nlabeled with inmate numbers (001-006) and all 6 right hand hooks are labeled with tally marks from 1 to \n6. As the chains are connected to their opposite hooks, the two pieces of information are connected \ncreating an order of inmate numbers.\nStep 2: 6 inmate uniforms are found in the tall locker, each labeled with their inmate numbers (e.g IN001) \nand a character name, (e.g Catwoman). By ordering the inmates numbers using the tally marks on the \nchains, you in turn create an order of character names from 1st to 6th.\nStep 3: Found unlocked throughout the penitentiary are 6 inmate profiles, one for each character. Other \nthan the names on the profiles, the rest of the information is decorative. Use the order of the character \nnames from the above steps to order the inmate profiles from 1st to 6th. Hang the profiles on the inmate \nprofile board above the desk in the same order to complete this puzzle.\nCode & Connections: \n Chain Connections and Inmate Profile Order:\n \n- Tally 1 - IN001 - Catwoman\n \n- Tally 2 - IN003 - Two Face\n \n- Tally 3 - IN006 - Clayface\n \n- Tally 4 - IN002 - Riddler\n \n- Tally 5 - IN004 - Penguin\n \n- Tally 6 - IN005 - The Joker\nEvent:  Unlock Door.

The Joker\u2019s message \ncontains a cryptic message that needs working out. Within the third paragraph of text are certain words \nthat when read backwards, spell new recognisable words. For example \u201cStabs\u201d can be read backwards \nto reveal the new word \u201cBats\u201d.. \nStep 2: Printed on the lower portion of the walls in the Holding Cell are naughts and crosses style \ngames, each with different icons in certain positions within the grid pattern. The first part of this puzzle \nis identifying the backwards words in the Joker\u2019s message before matching them to one of the icons on \nthe wall. \nStep 3: Notice that the grid patterns in the naughts and crosses style games, mimic the outlines of a \n9-grid electronic keypad. Use this information to turn the key words and icons from the Joker\u2019s message, \ninto a code. There are six words to find in the Joker\u2019s message, therefore there are 6 significant icons \nthat should be translated into a six digit code \nCode: \n 4 9 8 7 2 6\nEvent:  Unlock Electrical Cabinet 01 to find: Fuse cavity chart, (for \u2018Fuse Board Override\u2019)\nPuzzle Photos\nBATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT CHALLENGE\n18\nV1\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nPUZZLE 7: Exterior Fans\nStep 1: Upon entering the rooftop, an exterior fan can be found immediately on the left hand wall. Notice \nthat there are four rotating blades inside the fan unit that are spinning at full speed. \nStep 2: On the front of the fan unit is a removable front panel hiding a switch behind it. This switch can \nbe used to turn the fans from their ON to the OFF position. Turning this switch from ON to OFF brings the \nfans to a complete stop. Now that the fans are not moving, you can see the hidden lettering written on \nthem that you couldn\u2019t before as they were moving. \nStep 3: Written along the blades of the fan is a riddle reading, \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t kill you makes you \n????????\u201d. The answer to the riddle is \u2018stranger\u2019, which is the code required to be entered into an \nelectronic keypad. Find the keypad mounted to the side of the fan unit, with a spotlight pointed directly \nat it at the time. This letter to number keypad will allow you to type in \u201cstranger\u201d without the need to \ntranslate to numbers.\nCode & Connections: \n Stranger\nEvent:  Unlock Wooden Crate\nPuzzle Photos\nBATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT CHALLENGE\n19\nV1\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nPUZZLE 8: Fuse Board Override\nStep 1: The electrical cabinet contains the fuse cavity chart printed onto the inside door. The fuse cavity \nchart uses a logic style puzzle to reveal the correct position of each amp labeled fuse. For example: \u201c15A \nmust be two spaces away from 40A\u201d or \u201c35A cannot be on the same row as 5A\u201d.. \nStep 2: This type of logic instruction will perfectly place all fuses within their correct cavities inside the \nfuse cabinet. One will be found fixed in place at the start which becomes your reference point for the \nrest of the puzzle.\nStep 3: Placing all fuses in their correct slots unlocks the cabinet beside it, that contains a knife switch \nwith an up and down position that represents ON and OFF. Pull the switch from its OFF position to its ON \nposition to complete this puzzle and activate the gargoyle game. \nCodes & Connections: \n Slot 1, (top left): 20A\n Slot 2: 35A\n Slot 3: 30A\n Slot 4, (top right): 10A\n Slot 5, (bottom left): 15A - this fuse is fixed down from the start\n Slot 6: 25A\n Slot 7: 40A\n Slot 8, (bottom right): 5A\nEvent:  Activate Gargoyle Game, (for \u2018Laugh-O\u2019matic Deactivation\u2019).\nPuzzle Photos\nBATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT CHALLENGE\n20\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nV2\nPUZZLE 9: Joker Cards\nStep 1: Throughout the game, four Joker cards are going to be found in various locked and unlocked \nlocations, one of which will be fixed into the Laugh-O\u2019matic. The cards have specific color designs on the \nback, (e.g. green) and a card suit on the front (e.g. Spade).\nStep 2: Above each card slot are two coloured wires. The color combinations of those wires creates \na new color matching to one of four Joker cards. For example if the two wires above card slot one are \nblue and yellow, the green Joker card must be placed there directly below the wire inputs. One Joker \nCard is fixed in place to indicate which way up the cards must face when put in position. Their card suit \nmust face up, as the card suits must be clearly visible as you move onto the next puzzle. \nStep 3: Match each card to its slot using the color theory; there is no specific order, just as long as \neach card ends up in the correct slot. The puzzle is complete once all cards are in their correct slots. In \ndoing so, four circular buttons and an interactive light bar on the device will light up indicating they are \nactivated and ready to be used. \nCode & Connections: \n Green / Spade card: Slot 1 (far left)\n \n- Blue and yellow wires make green\n Orange / Club card: Slot 2\n \n- Red and yellow wires make orange \n Purple / Heart card: Slot 3\n \n- Blue and red wires make purple \n Pink / Diamond card: Slot 4 (far right)\n \n- Red and white wires make pink\nEvent:  Activate Device Controls, (for \u2018Laugh-O\u2019matic Deactivation\u2019).\nPuzzle Photos\nBATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT CHALLENGE\n21\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nPUZZLE 10: Laugh-O\u2019matic Deactivation\nStep 1: Around the four corners of the room are large gargoyle statues, each one with a card suit on their \nchest (e.g Spade, Club, Diamond or Heart). Upon actioning the knife switch from the fuse board override \npuzzle, the gargoyle eyes will light up changing from red (their steady color throughout the game) to \ngreen. Once the knife switch is turned on, each of the gargoyle eyes will flash green one at a time in a \nsequence of four. This creates an order of the card suits on their chests.\nStep 2: The Laugh-O\u2019matic contains four buttons, each one corresponding with a card suit due to how \nthey are sat underneath the Joker Cards. Watch the gargoyle eye sequence and copy the card suit \norder on the device buttons, pressing them one at a time from 1st to 4th. If correct, a square on the \ninteractive indicator bar will shine green. Every five minutes that elapses after the start of the puzzle, a \nred light on the indicator bar will shine red. The interactive indicator is designed with three green lights \nand three red lights built into it. To win the game, you must get three sequences in a row correct before \nyou get three wrong. In other words, you must get three green lights before you get three red lights. \nThis gives you 15 minutes to complete the puzzle successfully. \nStep 3: After successfully completing the gargoyle game by activating three green lights on the device, \na red deactivation button built into the device will be unlocked. A secondary deactivation button can \nbe found on the rooftop, unlocked with a standard padlock and key. These are the simultaneous \ndeactivation buttons and they must be pressed at the same time to deactivate the laugh-o\u2019matic device, \nstop the timer and escape!\nCode & Connections: \n Club; Spade; Heart; Diamond\n Spade; Club; Spade; Heart\n Diamond; Club; Heart; Club\nEvent:  Stop the Timer & Escape\nPuzzle Photos\nGAMEPLAY\nBATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT CHALLENGE\n23\nV1\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nReset List\nRoom 4 - Wayne Tower Rooftop\n1.

You approach the temple confidently, but once inside angered spirits \nawaken and deem you unworthy of the riches held within. \nAs a test, they grant you 60 minutes to prove your worth. You must work logically, interact with \neverything you find and solve puzzles to uncover the treasure! If you fail, the door will be sealed once \nmore and you will surely perish! \nCan you locate the journal, find the treasure and escape the temple before it\u2019s too late?

Added vines, ropes and hanging plants can be added to the walls to enhance them along with \nflickering lantern lighting. Dim colored lighting including green, purple, blue and red tones can be used \nin addition to standard lantern lighting to darken the room and help achieve the aesthetic we are looking \nfor.\nThe doorway into the second room will have a decorative panel cover to blend it in with the rest of the \nenvironment, swinging open revealing the next space. \nThe large God\u2019s Eye statue is also found in this room, both incorporated into one of the puzzles and \nused as a feature prop. The remainder of this room will be filled with the props and prints provided in the \ngame.\nRoom 2 - The Cave\nThe second room can be dressed similarly to the first, using the same walls, floors and decor items. \nTo create contrast between rooms, the lighting can be switched up with the colors used in one room \ndiffering from the next.\nRoom 3 - The Treasure Room\nThis room is a little darker than the other two, being the treasure room it should appear as if it has not \nbeen entered for a long time. On the left hand side of the room players see the body of Archibald \nTucker along with a treasure chest on the opposing side. The back wall of the room is a wall of \nhieroglyphics used as part of the final puzzle of the game.\nFlooring can be the same as in Room 1 and Room 2.\nLOST CITY\n10\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nV1\nGame Room Photos\nRoom 1\nLOST CITY\n11\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nV1\nGame Room Photos\nRoom 2\nLOST CITY\n12\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nV1\nGame Room Photos\nRoom 3\nLOST CITY\n13\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nV1\nExample 3D Renderings\nPlease note that the 3D renders are not an exact match of the environments and should be taken as \ninspiration only.\nLOST CITY\n14\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nV1\nExample 3D Renderings\nLOST CITY\n15\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nV1\nExample 3D Renderings\nPUZZLES\nLOST CITY\n17\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nV1\nPuzzles\nNumber \nName  \n \n \nPuzzle 1 \nSentence by Numbers\nPuzzle 2 \nTile by Numbers\nPuzzle 3 \nMaze Tiles\nPuzzle 4 \nSnake Box\nPuzzle 5 \nGrab the Journal\nPuzzle 6 \nGod\u2019s Eye\nPuzzle 7 \nRope Hang\nPuzzle 8 \nRelease the Templates\nPuzzle 9 \nWheel of Truth\nPuzzle 10 \nHieroglyph Wal\nLOST CITY\n18\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nV1\nPuzzle 1: Sentence by Numbers\nStep 1: As players enter the game room they will be provided with a backpack filled with various items \nincluding handheld blacklight torches.\nStep 2: When they turn on the UV torches, they will see a gold engraved plaque on the wall that reads \nas follows:\n\u201cWELCOME GREEDY SOULS. FEW HAVE ENTERED THOUGH NONE HAVE LEFT. DO NOT \nUNDERESTIMATE THE WEIGHT OF THAT. GO FOURTH WITH CAUTION AND RESPECT OR OUR \nWRATH WILL COME DOWN SIXFOLD.\u201d\nStep 3: Hidden in the words are four numbers, 1,8,4,6. These four numbers will open up a four number \nlock on a decorative leather wooden trunk in Room 1.

One side of each \ntile is a number and the other is a letter. If players group the tiles together by their numbers and then \nunscramble the letters on the other side they will notice they spell out different colors. You will end up \nwith six groups of tiles, grouped from one to four, creating an order of the colors on the front. \nStep 2: By this time, players will have already found missing journal entry 1, which shows the different \ncolors on the page, and gives them a numerical value. For example, the color blue may be represented \nby a number 7 on the journal asset. As blue is the first in the color sequence created by the tiles, the first \ndigit in the code will be 7.\nStep 3: The color order you receive from the tiles is as follows: Blue, Yellow, Green, Blue, Green, Red. \nUsing the journal asset this translates to the following digit code: 789796.

Players will have to use logic to pick out numbers that have \nbeen hidden in the plaques of each wine bottle. For example: \u201cComes from the vineyard operated by six \ngenerations of his family\u201d. Across all six wine bottles and six plaques, players will gather 6 unique digits.\nStep 2: Also written on the plaques are the regions in which each wine comes from. For example: \n\u201cBaron\u2019Arques comes from the Languedoc Region of France\u201d. Using the Wine Regions of France asset, \nyou can see that each region is marked by a number. For example: 5 = Burgundy, 7 = Beaujolais, 3 = \nMoselle, 16 = Bordelais, 12 = Languedoc, and 2 = Champagne. Using the \u2018orderly gathering of friends\u2019 \nasset framed on the wall, notice hidden numbers within the painting that order the wine region numbers, \ntherefore ordering the wines themselves.\nStep 3: With the wine bottles in a specific order, you can order the originally single digit numbers that \nwere discovered on their plaques, creating a 6 digit code. For example; as 16 is the first number in the \n\u2018orderly gathering of friends\u2019 asset, wine region 16 (Bordeaux) is first in the order. The corresponding \nwine plaque contains the hidden number 3, making this the first digit in the code. This number should be \nentered into a keypad that will unlock a lower compartment built into the animal display case \nCode: \n 315264\nEvent:  Unlock the rope compartment. \nWHO STOLE MONA\n17\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2025 - strictly confidential\nV1\nPUZZLE 8: SHIP\u2019S CANVAS \nStep 1: Inside the newly unlocked compartment you will find a letter to Vlad and three buoys with a \nrope and a hook on the end. Using logic, players can connect these items to the painting of the yacht \n\u2018Mona Lisa\u2019. Underneath the image is a framed section of canvases that need to have the rope and hook \nattached to be pulled up (like a sail). Once the canvases are pulled up they form a riddle. The first part of \nthe riddle is a knock knock clue, that when followed on the starry night plaque, activates LED windows \naround the room. The windows are in groups across the South, West, East and North walls of the room. \nEach of those groups are also shining a different color. \nStep 2: The second part is as follows:\n\u201c5th of August to\nThe beginning of November\nFirst Thing Wednesday\nMiddle of September\u201d.\nFrom this, players should take the fifth letter from August, (S). The first letter from November, (N). The first \nletter of Wednesday, (W). And the middle letter from September, (E).  These letters create a sequence \nof directions: South, North, West, East. Players must order the groups of windows in this order, taking \nthe South window group first, ending in the East window group. Printed on the floor is a large compass, \nrevealing the correct orientation of the room to assist. \nStep 3: By counting each of the colored windows, in the order of their directional groups, this creates \nan association between a color and a specific number such as green = 3. To input this code, use the \ncolored buttons on the wall located underneath the animal paintings. For example, with South as the first \ndirection, and the group of windows on the South wall being green, count the numbers of windows in \nthat group to find there are three, therefore green = 3. \nOrder of Directions: South, North, West, East.\nColored Button Sequence: \n Green - 3 times\n Yellow - 4 times\n Blue - 8 times\n Red - 6 times\nEvent:  Activate the spotlight and reveal the \u2018Laser Maze\u2019 instructions. \nWHO STOLE MONA\n18\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2025 - strictly confidential\nV1\nPUZZLE 8: SHIP\u2019S CANVAS  cont\u2026\nWHO STOLE MONA\n19\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2025 - strictly confidential\nV1\nPUZZLE 9: LASER MAZE\nStep 1: In completing the previous puzzle, players will be guided towards a spotlight shining down \ninto one area of the room; this is enhanced by the rest of the room lights being off. Beside that is a tv, \nrevealing a set of instructions: \u201cAre you all in the spotlight? Then press the white button! (red button kills \nthe alarm!) Green button = Try Again!\u201d. At the same time, a blast of fog will be pushed into the room that \nwill highlight the lasers once they show. Built into the tv frame are the white and green buttons required \nto follow these instructions. \nStep 2: Once players press the white button, green lasers will fill the room and the Mona Lisa will be \nrevealed from its covering. At this point, it is time to navigate through the laser maze without touching a \nlaser beam and setting off the alarms. If players trigger the lasers, they have to start over by pressing the \ngreen button, as written in the provided instructions. \nStep 3: Once you have successfully navigated the maze, you will find yourself standing in front of the \nMona Lisa. Pressing the red button under the picture will kill the alarm, returning the lights to normal. \nAfter this, the Mona Lisa will hinge open, revealing the maze behind it. \nEvent:  Open the Mona Lisa frame.\nWHO STOLE MONA\n20\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2025 - strictly confidential\nV1\nPUZZLE 10: THE MONA LISA MAZE\nStep 1: Once players have pressed the red button the Mona Lisa will open. It is on a hinged frame that \nonce open, players will see a maze set onto the wall. \nStep 2: Players will have to move magnetic pieces of the maze around in order to free one puck.

Room 1 is a traditional library in terms of its furniture and  \ndecorations but the colors used will build the cartoon aesthetic. There is a \u2018subtle \u2018glow\u2019 from the fake  \nfireplace in the room. The walls will be square paneled (wooden). We will use artificial lighting (DMX),  \ncolored, to enhance the atmosphere. \nSCOOBY-DOO AND THE SPOOKY CASTLE ADVENTURE\n10\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nV1\nRoom 2 - The Hallway\nRoom 2 is a castle hallway using a dark wooden colored wainscotting and red wallpaper for the walls  \nand black and white tiled, chequerboard flooring. The West wall will be a built-in wooden bookshelf  \nfilled with books, and on the East wall will be a large empty frame for the smaller pictures (previously  \nfound mounted along the empty space on all walls) to be inserted into.

The \nstart of each pipe is marked with individual colored \u2018monster residue\u2019, connecting each colored residue \nto one of six sections of the shelf it leads to. The shelf is for 6 monster cups found throughout the game; \nby now you will have unlocked them all. Each monster cup has a different item inside: Coffee beans, \npeppermints, oranges, strawberries, cupcakes, popcorn. \nStep 2: Shaggy\u2019s character clue reveals a newspaper article showing 6 ghost/monster sightings where \ndifferent colored \u2018residue\u2019 had been found. The locations listed have a correlation to the items inside the \nmonster cups; for example, a coffee house or the movie theater. This information connects each of the \ncolored monster residues to a location and the specific monster cup that matches that location. \nStep 3: Using this information, each of the monster cups can now be placed on a specific section of the \nshelf, underneath the pipes from the pipe maze. For example, Shaggy\u2019s character clue tells you \u2018Green \nslime was found all over the Crystal Cove Coffee House\u2019.

The spinning wooden bases have degree numbers printed on them \nso players can turn each of the heads to a specific degree.  \nStep 2: The future scare plans journal contains 4 entries revealing future \u2018monster scare\u2019 locations each \nlinking with a particular masked monster, (e.g, Scooby\u2019s Shake Shack is the perfect place to release \nmy next monstrous creation). The etched lines on the plexi frame go straight through degree numbers \ntelling players which degree to turn each mask to.\nStep 3: Players will know which monster goes to which degree based on the journal entries. Once the \nmonster heads are turned correctly to align with their correct degrees, a compartment in the monster \nbench will open revealing items for future puzzles including whodunnit pieces, a Scooby Snack and the \nwhodunnit clue list. \nCode: \n 1st case = Robot (entry 03) = Snack Shack = 300 degrees\n 2nd case = Clown (entry 02) = Museum = 150 degrees\n 3rd case = Wich (entry 07) = City Hall = 60 degrees\n 4th case = Creeper (entry 06) = Cove = 210 degrees.\nEvent:  Unlock monster bench compartment.

A total of 15 magnetic whodunnit pieces\u2019 are found throughout the game to fit into the \ncutouts on the board. The aim is to match each piece to its correct position on the board.\nStep 2: The suspects going into column A can only fit into one specific place due to their size, therefore \nno further clues are needed to complete this column. The correct locations of the 10 remaining \nwhodunnit pieces will be revealed within the Whodunnit clue list. As described in the House Plan Jigsaw \npuzzle, players will need to go back to Room 1 to look at the House Plan Jigsaw and the number of \ndots next to them to assign room names.

The whodunnit board reveals the kidnap item was a rope, revealing the \nvillain is the Butler.\n Chef - Room 1 - Zip Ties \n Gardener - Room 2 - Duct Tape \n Nanny - Room 3 - Sleeping Mask \n Butler - Room 4 - Rope \n Maid - Room 5 - Cloth Bag \nStep 3: The next step is to open the safe hidden behind a picture on the wall. Use the safe cracker asset \nto answer questions and use the visual keypad to translate the answers into digit codes for the safe. The \nitems inside the safe are needed to complete the final puzzle.\n #1 = The Villain = The Butler = Number 3 on safe \n #2 = The Suspect in the Billiards Room = The Maid = Number 1 on safe \n #3 = Where was The Gardener = The Dining Room = Number 7 on safe \n #4 = The kidnap equipment in The Kitchen = Zip Ties = Number 6 on safe\n #5 = The kidnap equipment used by the villain = The Rope = Number 4 on safe\n #6 = Who used the duct tape = The Gardener = Number 2 in safe \n #7 = Scooby-Doo = Letter A on safe \nCode: \n 317642A. \nEvent:  Unlock the safe.\nSCOOBY-DOO AND THE SPOOKY CASTLE ADVENTURE\n32\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nV1\nSCOOBY-DOO AND THE SPOOKY CASTLE ADVENTURE\n33\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nV1\nPUZZLE 13: Mysterious Pillars\nStep 1: Around room 3 are stone pillars. Each pillar is made of six large stones each with an engraved \nsymbol. There are 18 symbols in total. The pillars are backlit with orange, red and green colors. Found \ninside the safe, unlocked using the code from the Whodunnit puzzle, is an asset written by the villain, the \nButler. It reveals the following coordinates: B4, 2C, 2B, 4A, 4C & 2A. \nStep 2: As each stone pillar is marked with a letter, you can use the coordinates to identify specific \nsymbols on the stone pillars. For example, coordinate \u2018B4\u2019 would lead you to the pillar marked B and \nthe 4th symbol on that pillar. The Butler\u2019s message will also give away the translations to each of the \nsymbols, allowing you to translate the pillar symbols into letters that can spell the word \u2018SPOOKY\u2019. This is \nthe code for the cipher wheel, something the Butler\u2019s message will also hint at. \nStep 3: The cipher wheel instructions framed on the wall of room 3 will explain the steps to entering the \ncode word \u2018SPOOKY\u2019 into the cipher wheel, with the end result being those 6 letters being turned into a \n6 digit code; this is your exit code. The exit code should be entered into the exit keypad located on the \nexit box in room 1, beside the entry/exit door to stop the timer and escape. \nExit Code:\n 541576\nEvent:  Stop the timer and escape! \nGAMEPLAY\nSCOOBY-DOO AND THE SPOOKY CASTLE ADVENTURE\n35\n\u00a9ESCAPOLOGY 2024 - strictly confidential\nV1\nReset List\nRoom 3:  Monster Lab\n1.
